# Deterministic Signal Rules

Use these rules to reduce subjectivity in scoring. These are **signals and bounds**, not automatic final verdicts.

## Rule A: Prompt-only state dependence

**Trigger:** The prompt requires tracking retry count, clarification count, survey state, or whether a user already provided information, AND no explicit state object exists.

**Scoring bounds:**
- State & Conflict Manageability should generally not exceed **2**
- Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **3**

**Why:** LLMs cannot reliably maintain hidden counters or conversation status across turns. This creates guaranteed compliance failures.

**Example red flags:**
- "remember what was said earlier"
- "avoid asking for information already provided"
- "max ONE retry per request" (without external counter)
- "never ask the same question twice" (without external flag)

---

## Rule B: Exact phrase burden

**Trigger 1:** Exact-response phrases are greater than **5**

**Effect:** Note followability risk. Treat this as strong evidence that exactness may compete with other constraints (tone, brevity, context-awareness).

**Trigger 2:** Exact-response phrases are greater than **10**

**Effect:** Treat prompt-only compliance as highly fragile. The agent will fail to produce the correct exact phrase in many scenarios.

**Why:** Each exact phrase requirement adds cognitive load and reduces flexibility. When combined with other constraints, exact phrases create a high failure rate.

**What counts as an exact phrase:**
- "Respond EXACTLY with: ..."
- "Say EXACTLY: ..."
- "Your response text should say EXACTLY: ..."
- Any requirement for word-for-word reproduction

---

## Rule C: Nested rule burden

**Trigger 1:** The prompt contains more than **10** meaningful nested if/then branches

**Effect:** Note high workflow complexity risk.

**Trigger 2:** The prompt contains more than **20** meaningful nested if/then branches

**Effect:** Treat instruction-only compliance as highly fragile unless workflow logic is externalized to a state machine.

**Trigger 3:** The prompt contains more than **30** meaningful nested if/then branches

**Effect:** Treat instruction-only compliance as near-impossible. The agent cannot reliably navigate the full branch space in a single generation pass. Partial compliance is the expected outcome, not the edge case.

**Trigger 4:** The prompt contains more than **40** meaningful nested if/then branches

**Effect:** Treat instruction-only compliance as not achievable. Prompt-only control over this many branches will fail even under favorable conditions.

**Scoring bounds:**
- Prompts with >20 branches: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **2**
- Prompts with >30 branches: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **1**
- Prompts with >40 branches: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **0**

**Why:** Deep nesting exceeds LLM working memory and creates navigation errors. The agent will get lost in branches, especially when workflows interact. Beyond 20 branches, the agent must hold a decision tree that exceeds the reliable working-memory capacity of most production LLMs during response generation. Beyond 30 branches, the tree is large enough that the agent will routinely follow the wrong path even with the prompt fully in context. Beyond 40 branches, the branching logic has grown into a workflow engine and belongs in deterministic tooling, not a prompt.

**What counts as a nested branch:**
- If/then/else conditions
- Exception clauses that modify other rules
- Multi-step workflows with branching
- Conditional sub-workflows

---

## Rule D: Tool-required behavior gap

**Trigger:** The prompt requires a tool call but does not specify trigger, input, output handling, AND failure handling.

**Effect:** Note an execution grounding gap. Treat tool reliability as weak or incomplete.

**Why:** Without complete tool specification, the agent must guess at invocation syntax, parameters, and result interpretation. This creates execution failures.

**Required for complete tool specification:**
1. **Tool name:** Explicit identifier (e.g., `search_knowledge_base`)
2. **Trigger conditions:** When to call the tool (e.g., "when user asks a question")
3. **Parameters:** What inputs to provide (e.g., "pass user query as `query` parameter")
4. **Result handling:** What to do with tool output (e.g., "summarize the results")
5. **Failure handling:** What to do if tool fails (e.g., "offer transfer to human")

---

## Rule E: Prompt length and attention drift

**Trigger 1:** The prompt exceeds **100 lines** of instruction content

**Effect:** Note attention drift risk. The agent may struggle to keep all constraints active simultaneously during response generation.

**Trigger 2:** The prompt exceeds **150 lines** of instruction content

**Effect:** Treat followability as fragile. The agent is likely to miss or forget constraints, especially those mentioned early or late in the prompt.

**Trigger 3:** The prompt exceeds **200 lines** of instruction content

**Effect:** Treat followability as highly fragile. Partial compliance is very likely. The agent is unlikely to reliably attend to all parts of the prompt.

**Scoring bounds:**
- Prompts >150 lines: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **2**
- Prompts >200 lines: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **1**

**Why:** LLMs have limited attention span during response generation. Very long prompts increase the risk of attention drift where constraints mentioned early may be forgotten by the time the agent generates a response, and constraints mentioned late may not be properly integrated with earlier context. This risk is especially high when the prompt contains dense procedural logic, nested conditions, or many interacting rules.

**Performance effect:** Long prompts also increase input token cost and may increase latency. When long prompts contain dense procedural logic, the model may spend additional reasoning effort resolving which rules apply, leading to slower and more variable responses.

**What counts toward line count:**
- Instruction content (rules, constraints, workflows, examples)
- Do NOT count: blank lines, section headers alone, or pure metadata
- Adjust for density: 100 lines of dense nested logic ≈ 150+ lines of simple instructions

**Attention drift patterns:**
- Early constraints forgotten when processing later sections
- Late constraints not integrated with earlier context
- Middle sections most vulnerable to being skipped or misremembered
- Interacting rules across distant sections fail to coordinate

---

## Rule F: Active operational rule burden

**What this rule measures:** The number of operational rules that may simultaneously apply to a single user turn. This is distinct from total rule count (Rule E measures bulk) and nested branches (Rule C measures structural complexity). A 100-rule prompt can be manageable if only 3–5 rules apply per turn. A 15-rule prompt can be unachievable if all 15 fire at once.

**What counts as an active operational rule:**
- A MUST / NEVER / ALWAYS constraint relevant to the current turn
- A conditional branch that may apply to the current input
- A required output-format constraint
- A tool invocation rule
- A failure-handling rule
- A state-dependent rule (e.g., "only ask once per call")
- An exact phrase requirement
- A safety / refusal / escalation rule

**What does not count:**
- Section headers and background context
- Examples that are not binding
- General style preferences that do not compete with operational requirements
- Rules scoped to a different task or flow that cannot apply to the current turn

**Active rule budget:**
| Active rules per turn | Risk level | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| 0–5 | Low | Realistic target for most production agents |
| 6–10 | Manageable | Acceptable if rules are independent and prioritized |
| 11–20 | High | Followability becomes dependent on rule independence, prioritization, and prompt structure |
| 21–30 | Fragile | Prompt-only compliance is fragile; move branching, state, and validation into workflow or tooling |
| 30+ | Not achievable | Prompt is acting as a workflow engine; decompose into deterministic control logic |

**Scoring bounds:**
- More than 10 active rules per turn: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **3**
- More than 20 active rules per turn: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **2**
- More than 30 active rules per turn: Instruction Followability should generally not exceed **1**

**Key distinction:** Not all rules are equal. The budget is tighter for interacting rules than for independent ones:
- Simple style rules (e.g., "be concise", "avoid jargon"): 5–15 realistic
- Output-format rules: 3–7 realistic; 10+ risky
- Critical behavioral rules (MUST / NEVER / ALWAYS): 5–9 realistic; 10+ risky
- Conditional rules: 5–10 realistic; see also Rule C
- Exact phrase rules: 0–3 realistic; 5+ risky (see Rule B)
- Stateful rules: 0–2 realistic; any hidden counter/state is risky (see Rule A)
- Tool-use rules: 1–5 tools/flows realistic; any underspecified behavior is risky (see Rule D)

**The control-plane principle:** Rules about routing, retries, tool selection, escalation, validation, state transitions, "only ask once," or "after failure do X" are control-plane rules. They belong in deterministic workflow, explicit state, or tool contracts — not in the prompt. When these rules appear in the prompt, count them in the active rule budget and treat their presence as a signal that logic should be externalized.

**Why:** LLMs can follow a modest number of independent, prioritized rules. They struggle with large numbers of simultaneously active, interacting, stateful, or conflicting rules. The useful budget is not total rules in the prompt; it is active operational rules per turn.

---

## Rule G: Performance friction from instruction complexity

**Trigger:** The prompt contains a high volume of interacting constraints, long instruction content, ambiguous tool triggers, conflicting rules, or workflow logic that must be resolved by the LLM at runtime.

**Effect:** Note performance risk in addition to followability risk. The agent may require more reasoning tokens, produce longer outputs, call tools unnecessarily, enter correction loops, or show higher latency variance.

**Performance risk indicators:**
- Prompt length exceeds 100 / 150 / 200 instruction lines (see Rule E)
- Nested conditional branches exceed 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 (see Rule C)
- Active operational rules per turn exceed 10 / 20 / 30 (see Rule F)
- Tool trigger rules are ambiguous or overlapping
- Multiple rules compete in the same turn without priority
- The prompt asks the model to decide, execute, validate, remember, and recover in one pass
- Exact phrase requirements interact with tone, format, safety, or tool-use constraints
- Failure handling is prompt-only rather than workflow-managed

**Scoring impact:**
- Does not automatically reduce every dimension score
- Should influence Instruction Followability and Execution & Tool Grounding when applicable
- Should be called out separately as a Runtime Performance Risk in the report

**Why:** Unclear or conflicting instructions increase the amount of runtime deliberation needed to produce a compliant response. Even when the model eventually answers correctly, it may do so with higher latency, higher token usage, more tool calls, or greater variance across turns. Achievability is not only "can the model produce the right behavior?" — it is also "can the model produce the right behavior predictably, cheaply, and with bounded runtime variance?"

---

## Rule H: Skill single-responsibility violation (SK-1)

**Trigger:** A skill's `SKILL.md` body describes more than one primary workflow, covers more than one unrelated intent category, or calls tools from more than one logical domain.

**Effect:** Note complexity inflation. The skill is acting as a mini-orchestrator rather than a focused instruction module.

**Scoring bounds (apply to the skill's own dimension scores in the skill report — not to agent-level dimensions):**
- 2 primary workflows in one skill: Instruction Followability (Dimension 4) for that skill should generally not exceed **3**
- 3+ primary workflows in one skill: Instruction Followability for that skill should generally not exceed **2**

**Why:** A skill that does multiple things compounds its own complexity and makes routing ambiguous. When loaded, the agent must reason over multiple independent workflows simultaneously — the reliability failure mode is the same as overly long agent instructions.

---

## Rule I: Skill scope overlap (SK-2)

**Trigger:** Two or more skills share detectable scope for the same user intent, topic, or trigger condition based on their `description` frontmatter or explicit scope statements in the body.

**Overlap ratings and scoring bounds:**

| Rating | Definition | Score impact on **agent** Dimension 2 (Scope & Applicability) |
|---|---|---|
| **Exact** | Same intent, same wording in both descriptions | Should not exceed **1** |
| **High** | Same intent, different wording | Should not exceed **2** |
| **Moderate** | Shared boundary conditions or edge cases | Note as risk; reduce by 1 if multiple pairs |
| **Low** | Tangential overlap only | Note only; no automatic score bound |

> **Scope:** SK-2 overlap degrades the *agent's* ability to route correctly — it affects agent Dimension 2 directly. This is one of the few SK findings that reaches the agent-level scorecard (see scoring guidance in SKILL.md).

**Why:** When two skills overlap, the agent must decide which to load without reliable disambiguation. This forces judgment-based routing at exactly the point where deterministic routing is most important — the moment the agent selects its instruction context. Routing errors at this point cascade: the agent loads the wrong instructions, calls the wrong tools, and returns the wrong behavior.

---

## Rule J: Skill routing clarity and frontmatter validation (SK-3)

**Routing clarity triggers:**
**Trigger 1:** A skill's `description` frontmatter does not explicitly state the intents it covers.
**Trigger 2:** A skill's `description` frontmatter does not include any boundary conditions (what it does NOT cover).
**Trigger 3:** A skill `name` is generic enough to match multiple skills in the same agent (e.g., `general`, `helper`, `support`).

**Hard-limit triggers (skill will not load — report as hard failures before any dimension scoring):**
**Trigger 4:** Skill `name` exceeds 64 characters. The skill cannot be imported. Report as a hard failure — evaluation scope is limited because the skill is unreachable in production.
**Trigger 5:** Skill `description` exceeds 1024 characters. The skill will not load. Report as a hard failure.
**Trigger 6:** Any `{{identifier}}` placeholder in the description or body has no matching `param` entry in the frontmatter. The placeholder is rendered as a literal gap in the text the model reads. Report each unmatched placeholder as a hard failure.

**Effect:**
- Triggers 1–3: Note routing clarity risk. Each trigger reduces the determinism of skill selection.
- Triggers 4–6: Report as hard failures. These are import/load blockers — the skill is non-functional until fixed.

**Scoring bounds:**
- Trigger 4, 5, or 6 present: Score all dimensions 0 — the skill cannot function. Add a note: "Scores are notional; the skill must be fixed before re-evaluation."
- Trigger 1 alone: Dimension 2 should generally not exceed **3**
- Trigger 1 + 2 together: Dimension 2 should generally not exceed **2**
- Trigger 3: Dimension 2 should generally not exceed **3**
- All three routing triggers (1–3) on the same skill: Dimension 2 should generally not exceed **1**

**Why:** The agent selects a skill to load based primarily on the skill's `name` and `description`. If either is vague or missing boundary conditions, the agent cannot reliably distinguish this skill from alternatives at routing time. Every skill load decision made without clear description-level guidance is effectively a guess. Hard-limit violations are separate from quality — they are binary blockers that prevent the skill from being reachable at all.

---

## Rule J2: Redundant or conflicting platform content (SK-8)

**What this rule checks:** Whether a skill body or the agent instructions contain content that is either (a) already injected by the platform, or (b) describes fixed platform behavior that the author cannot change. Both categories produce the same failure modes: wasted tokens on every turn and a second authoritative source that can drift from reality.

**Why repeating platform behavior is worse than just redundant:** When an author's description of a fixed behavior disagrees even slightly with what the platform actually does, both versions are simultaneously in the agent's context. The agent has no way to resolve the contradiction and may behave unpredictably. The platform always wins — the author's text never overrides it.

**Items to flag — organized by category:**

**Category A — Content the platform injects automatically (true duplicates):**

| Item | Where NOT to write it |
|---|---|
| How to invoke a skill's scripts: syntax, argument names, invocation pattern | Skill body — the platform already injects this |
| How to read a reference file | Skill body — the platform already injects read mechanics |

**Category B — Fixed platform behavior the author cannot change (conflict risk):**

| Item | Where NOT to write it | Risk if written |
|---|---|---|
| When to call `load_skill`; that the active skill should not be reloaded | Agent instructions, skill body | Platform controls `load_skill` dispatch — author text cannot change when it fires; any mismatch is an in-context contradiction |
| That loading a skill replaces the previous one | Agent instructions, skill body | This is structural platform behavior; a subtly wrong description creates a contradiction the agent cannot resolve |
| That a reference file should not be read twice | Skill body | Platform manages reference state; instructing the agent not to re-read does nothing the platform does not already enforce, and an incorrect description conflicts |

**Category C — Content that belongs in a different location (misplaced):**

| Item | Wrong location | Right location | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| The skill's own name and purpose as a preamble | Top of skill body | Nowhere — omit entirely | The agent already knows which skill is loaded; a body preamble restating the name wastes tokens on every load |
| Routing trigger phrases (which user intents load this skill) | Agent instructions | Skill `description` frontmatter only | Writing them in agent instructions pays catalog tokens twice and creates two places for routing signal to drift apart |

**Triggers:**
- **Trigger 1 (Category A):** Skill body contains `load_skill` invocation mechanics, script invocation syntax, or reference read mechanics that the platform already injects.
- **Trigger 2 (Category B):** Agent instructions or skill body describe when `load_skill` fires, that it replaces the prior skill, or that references should not be read twice — fixed behaviors the author cannot override.
- **Trigger 3 (Category C — preamble):** Skill body opens with the skill's own name or a restatement of its purpose.
- **Trigger 4 (Category C — routing duplication):** Agent instructions repeat verbatim routing phrases already present in a skill's `description` frontmatter.

**Effect:**
- Category A: Flag as token waste. Recommend removing — the platform already provides this.
- Category B: Flag as conflict risk. Removing eliminates both the token cost and the possibility of an in-context contradiction.
- Category C: Flag as misplacement. Move to the right location (frontmatter) or remove entirely (preamble).

**Scoring bounds:** No dimension penalty — this is a token and maintainability issue, not an achievability issue. Report via Rule O (token optimization). Do **not** recommend adding any of the above items to author-written files.

---

## Rule K: Cross-skill dependencies, mid-body handoffs, and dependency loops (SK-4)

**Three cases — assess each independently:**

**Case 1 — Backward assumption (violation):** A skill's `SKILL.md` body assumes that another skill has already run, set state, or returned a value. Signals:
- Explicit reference to another skill having run, a result from a prior skill, or state set by another skill
- Implicit state assumptions that could only exist if a specific prior skill had already executed (e.g., "the intent identified by the routing skill", "the product selected in the previous step")
- Instructions to "continue from where X skill left off" or similar
- Reference to a tool exclusively owned by another skill (in that skill's `allowed-tools` but not in the agent's top-level `tools:` or this skill's own `allowed-tools`)

**Case 2 — Mid-body `load_skill` (violation):** A skill body issues a `load_skill` call before its own work is complete, and the body has subsequent steps that implicitly require returning to this body. When the new skill loads, the current body is **replaced** — those subsequent steps are unreachable. Detect by checking whether `load_skill` appears before the skill's terminal step and whether steps follow it that depend on remaining in this body.

**Case 3 — Terminal handoff (document, not a violation):** A skill body issues `load_skill` as its final action after all its own work is done. This is valid — the skill has finished, and the conversation state carries forward for the next skill to use. Document these handoffs neutrally. If multiple skills form a forward chain (A → B → C → …), note the chain depth. Each hop replaces the previous body; a long chain is a "telephone game" risk — document it and leave the judgment to the author.

**Dependency loop check (violation — applies to all `load_skill` pointers, mid-body and terminal):**
Build a directed graph using forward `load_skill` pointers: draw an edge A → B for every `load_skill` call in skill A's body that targets skill B. Then check for cycles. A cycle means whichever skill loads second erases the first — neither can finish its work. Any cycle is a violation.

**How to check for loops:**
1. For each skill, collect all `load_skill` calls (mid-body and terminal).
2. Draw a directed edge skill A → skill B for each.
3. Check the graph for cycles of any length (A → B → A, or A → B → C → A, etc.).
4. Any cycle is a **loop violation** — report it as a separate finding, naming all skills in the cycle.

**Effect:**
- Case 1 (backward assumption): Note cross-skill coupling. Treat this skill as not independently executable.
- Case 2 (mid-body `load_skill`): Note unreachable steps — these are silently dropped when the new skill loads.
- Case 3 (terminal handoff): Document neutrally. Note chain depth if > 1 hop. No penalty.
- Dependency loop: Note a **routing deadlock**. No valid execution order exists. Report as a separate finding with higher severity.

**Scoring bounds (apply to the skill's own report):**
- Any Case 1 dependency: State & Conflict Manageability (Dimension 5) for this skill should generally not exceed **2**
- Any Case 2 mid-body `load_skill`: Execution & Tool Grounding (Dimension 3) for this skill should generally not exceed **2** (steps are unreachable)
- Multiple Case 1 or Case 2 instances: Dimension 5 should generally not exceed **1**
- Any dependency loop detected: State & Conflict Manageability should generally not exceed **1**; if the loop involves skills required for the agent's primary use cases, score **0**

**Why:** Each `load_skill` call replaces the active skill body — there is no mechanism to return to a previous body within the same turn. A backward assumption creates a hidden ordering contract the agent must maintain; LLMs cannot guarantee this. A mid-body `load_skill` silently discards remaining steps — the author may not notice, since the instructions are syntactically valid. A dependency loop makes it logically impossible for any skill in the cycle to load first without violating another's precondition.

---

## Rule L: Skill body complexity (SK-5)

**Trigger:** A skill's `SKILL.md` instruction body individually exceeds any of the Rule C, E, or F thresholds when analyzed in isolation.

**Effect:** Apply the corresponding Rule C / E / F scoring bounds to that skill's effective contribution to agent-level Dimensions 4 (Instruction Followability) and 3 (Execution & Tool Grounding). A skill that is itself unachievable degrades the whole agent's achievability even if the agent's own instructions are clean.

**Additional SK-5 trigger — hidden state inside a skill:** A skill body that tracks retry counts, clarification counts, or step state without an explicit state object (Rule A pattern) is doubly risky: the hidden state lives inside a dynamically-loaded module that may be unloaded and reloaded across turns.

**Additional SK-5 trigger — script misuse:** A skill body that:
- Instructs a script to call an external API or read a file (scripts are sandboxed; no network or file access — this will fail silently)
- References a script by an inexact path (the invocation may not resolve)
- Uses argument names in the body that do not match the script's declared parameters (silent failure at invocation)
- Reproduces a script's computation logic in prose (the model may do the math itself instead of calling the script)

**Additional SK-5 trigger — reference misuse:** A skill body that:
- Points to a reference with no condition (bare pointer — read every turn or never; ambiguous)
- Instructs reading the same reference more than once in a session (already in context after first read)
- Puts lookup tables or policy detail inline in the body instead of in a `references/` file (permanent token cost instead of on-demand)
- Uses an inexact reference path (may not resolve)

**Scoring bounds:** Use the same bounds as Rules A–F applied to the skill body in isolation, then apply any bound reduction to the skill's own dimension scores (not agent-level dimensions directly — see ST-8).

**Why:** Skills are not exempt from the complexity rules that govern agent instructions. A skill body is an instruction set — it is subject to attention drift (Rule E), nested branch overload (Rule C), active rule budget limits (Rule F), hidden state failure (Rule A), exact phrase brittleness (Rule B), and tool underspecification (Rule D). Scripts are sandboxed compute with no network or file access — instructions that assume otherwise create silent execution failures. References are read on demand; bare pointers and re-read instructions reflect a misunderstanding of the reference lifecycle.

## Rule M: Skill correlation and consolidation signal (SK-6)

**What this rule measures:** Whether two or more skills are so closely related in domain or trigger conditions that the agent will need to load them in sequential `load_skill` calls within a single user turn. Because each `load_skill` call replaces the active skill body, sequential loads carry two costs: each call adds a context-window write and inference pass, and the first skill's instructions are gone by the time the second loads.

**Platform model — how tools and skills interact:** In watsonx Orchestrate, tools must always be declared at the agent level first (`agent tools:`). This list is the authoritative registry — every tool any skill needs must appear here. A skill's `allowed-tools` is then a *filter*: it restricts which of the agent's declared tools are visible in that skill's context window. The following three categories result:

| Category | Declared in `agent tools:`? | In any skill's `allowed-tools`? | Callable at agent base level (no skill loaded)? | Callable inside the skill? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent-only tool** | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ (not in scope) |
| **Skill-filtered tool** | ✓ | ✓ (one or more skills) | ✗ — **shadowed** | ✓ (while that skill is active) |
| **Undeclared tool** | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ (doesn't exist) | ✗ (cannot be used) |

The critical implication: **a tool that appears in any skill's `allowed-tools` is removed from the agent's base tool set for the duration of that skill's activity — and at base level it is permanently unavailable.** An agent that references a skill-filtered tool in its own `instructions:` or `guidelines:` has a silent execution gap: the instruction looks valid but the tool is unreachable at the agent level.

**Note on shared tools:** Two skills listing the same tool in their `allowed-tools` is normal and expected — the tool is visible inside each of those skill contexts. Shared `allowed-tools` entries alone are not a correlation signal and do not trigger this rule.

**Trigger 1 — Adjacent trigger conditions:** Two skills cover adjacent user intents that commonly occur in the same turn (e.g., "check balance" and "recent transactions" are separate skills but users often ask both in one message). Each intent requires its own `load_skill` call; the first load is replaced when the second fires.

**Trigger 2 — Mid-body `load_skill` reference:** A skill body instructs the agent to call `load_skill` for another skill before that body's own work is complete. This is both a SK-4 violation (instruction-loss risk) and a coupling signal — the two skills cannot operate independently.

**Trigger 3 — Agent-level instruction references a skill-filtered tool (silent execution gap):** The agent's `instructions:` or `guidelines:` explicitly directs the agent to call a tool that also appears in at least one skill's `allowed-tools`. Because that tool is shadowed at the agent's base level, the call will silently fail whenever no skill is active. This is a **deterministic reliability violation** — the agent author has written an instruction the agent cannot execute in base context.

How to detect: for each tool named in agent `instructions:` or `guidelines:`, check whether it also appears in any skill's `allowed-tools`. Every match is a Trigger 3 violation. `extract_agent_info.py` surfaces these as tools that appear in `shadowed_resolved_tools` but NOT in `skill_only_tools` (i.e., the agent text does reference them — confirming the author's intent — but they are still shadowed).

Fix: either (a) remove the tool from the relevant skill's `allowed-tools` so it stays in the agent's base set, or (b) move the agent-level instruction that uses it into the skill body where the tool is accessible.

**Trigger 3a — Zero-tool base coverage (intentionality check):** A broader coverage check. If **every** tool in `agent tools:` appears in at least one skill's `allowed-tools`, then `active_resolved_tools` is empty — the agent has no tools at all before any skill loads. **This is a valid design for a pure skill-routing agent.** It is not an error. The evaluator's only job here is to confirm it is deliberate: look for an explicit statement in the agent `instructions:` that every user intent is handled through a skill, or that the agent does not act at base level. If such a statement exists, record the pattern as confirmed and move on — no finding, no score impact. If no such statement exists, raise a lightweight intentionality note asking the author to confirm.

Example: Agent declares tools `{a, b, c, d, e}`. Skill 1 has `allowed-tools: [a]`, Skill 2 has `[b]`, Skill 3 has `[c]`, Skill 4 has `[d]`, Skill 5 has `[e]`. Every tool is skill-filtered → `active_resolved_tools` is empty → agent enters each turn with zero tools. This is fine if every valid user intent routes through a skill. The author should confirm this is intentional, either explicitly in the instructions or by acknowledging it in the evaluation.

**Trigger 3b — Skill-only tool (informational, not a violation):** A tool is **skill-only** when (a) it is filtered by one or more skills' `allowed-tools` AND (b) its name does not appear anywhere in the agent's `instructions:` or `guidelines:` text. This means the agent never intended to call it at the base level — there is no execution gap and no author error. Note it in the report for authoring clarity; do not flag it as a violation.

**Token impact:** None. A tool declared in `agent tools:` contributes to the L1 token floor (its name and spec are loaded every turn at L1). If the same tool is also listed in a skill's `allowed-tools`, the spec is not double-counted — the `allowed-tools` filter is a runtime visibility restriction, not a second injection.

**Reliability impact summary:**
- **Trigger 3** (agent instruction references a skill-filtered tool): **High** — deterministic silent failure. The agent cannot execute the instruction. Fix required.
- **Trigger 3a** (zero `active_resolved_tools`, unconfirmed): **Intentionality note** — valid design pattern; raise only if no explicit confirmation is present in the agent instructions. No score impact when confirmed.
- **Trigger 3b** (skill-only tool, no agent reference): **None** — informational only.

`extract_agent_info.py` reports `active_resolved_tools` (truly accessible at L1), `shadowed_resolved_tools` (filtered by a skill), `skill_only_tools` (filtered AND not referenced in agent text — Trigger 3b), and `agent_callable_tools` (not filtered, or explicitly referenced in agent text).

**Consolidation recommendation trigger:** If both skills exhibit SK-2 Moderate/High overlap AND cover intents likely to co-occur in a single turn, OR if one skill's body issues a mid-body `load_skill` call to the other, recommend consolidation.

**Effect:** Note sequential-load performance risk. Log Trigger 3 violations as silent execution gaps (High severity). Log Trigger 3a as an intentionality check — raise a lightweight note if unconfirmed; no finding and no score impact if the author confirms pure skill-routing intent. Log correlated pairs with evidence.

**Scoring bounds:**
- 1 correlated pair (Trigger 1 or 2): skill-load overhead risk is **Medium**
- 2+ correlated pairs: skill-load overhead risk is **High**
- Any Trigger 3 violation (agent instruction references a skill-filtered tool): **High** — lowers agent Dimension 3 (Execution & Tool Grounding)
- Trigger 3a (zero `active_resolved_tools`, unconfirmed): **Intentionality note only** — does not lower any dimension score. Confirmed = no action needed.

**Why:** Loading a skill means injecting its `SKILL.md` body into the context window and replacing the previous one. When a user turn requires two sequential skill loads, the agent pays two context-window writes, and the first skill's instructions are completely absent during the second load. No instruction interference between the two bodies occurs — the first body is simply gone. The cost is latency (two inference passes), potential instruction loss, and routing complexity.

## Rule N: Skill context-load performance surface (SK-7)

**What this rule measures:** The total runtime cost introduced by the skill architecture itself, independent of any individual skill's complexity. Because only one skill body is in the prompt at a time, the cost model is per-load (not per-turn-sum). Each `load_skill` call replaces the previous body — two skills are never simultaneously active.

**Performance surface components — assess each:**

| Component | What to measure | Risk threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Skill count** | Total number of skills in `skills:` list | >5 skills: Medium; >10 skills: High |
| **Per-skill body size** | Lines of instruction in each SKILL.md body | >100 lines/skill: Medium; >150 lines/skill: High |
| **Skill selection decision cost** | How many skills are plausible candidates per average turn (ambiguity in routing) | >2 plausible candidates/turn: Medium; >4: High |
| **Load transitions per turn** | Estimated number of `load_skill` calls per turn for multi-step intents; each call replaces the active body | >1 transition/turn: Medium; >2 transitions/turn: High |
| **Re-load frequency** | Does the agent reload the same skill within a single turn? | Any confirmed same-skill reload: Medium |
| **Per-load token cost** | Tokens for the largest skill body likely to be loaded in one turn | >2,000 tokens: Medium; >4,000 tokens: High |

**Effect:** Produce a skill performance surface summary: list each component, its measured value, and its risk rating. Include this in the Runtime Performance Risk section of the report.

**Scoring bounds:**
- Any single component at High: Runtime performance risk for `skill_load_overhead_risk` should be rated **High**
- Two or more components at Medium with no High: rate **Medium**
- All components Low: rate **Low**

**Why:** Each `load_skill` call is not free. It replaces the active skill body in the context window, which costs input tokens and may trigger an additional inference pass. Because only one body is ever active, the relevant cost per turn is the token size of the loaded skill plus the number of load transitions — not the sum of all skill bodies. The total performance surface is: skill body size × expected load frequency × disambiguation cost.

## Rule O: Token consumption optimization

**What this rule measures:** Whether the agent's main instructions, skill catalog, and skill bodies together inflate per-turn token cost beyond what the functional requirements demand. Token inflation matters because the agent instructions and skill catalog are loaded on **every single turn**, and each skill body is injected on top of them when loaded — all sources compound. Excess tokens increase cost, increase latency, and reduce attention quality for constraints at the edges of a long context window.

**Three optimization surfaces — always assess all three:**

1. **Agent instructions (permanent per-turn cost):** These tokens are paid on every turn, not just when a skill is active. Reducing the agent instructions by 20 lines saves tokens on every call — the highest-leverage single change available. Look for: procedure steps that belong in tools, stateful protocol sections that belong in server-side state, exact-phrase rules that belong in plugins, redundant policy restatements, and overcrowded tool-call contract sections that repeat what a tool schema already specifies.

2. **Skill catalog (permanent per-turn cost):** Every skill's `name` and `description` are present in the prompt on every turn regardless of which skill is loaded. On a 12-skill agent this is a real recurring cost even when no skill is active. Look for: descriptions that have grown into paragraphs of procedure (the detail is only useful after the skill loads — it costs catalog tokens every turn for content the model can't act on yet).

3. **Skill bodies (per-skill-load cost):** These tokens are paid each time a skill is loaded — which for active intents can mean every turn. Only one skill body is active at a time; the cost is per-load, not per-turn-sum. Look for: oversized bodies, preamble duplication across multiple skill bodies, LLM-side classification tables, and exact-phrase enforcement that should live in plugins.

**Always produce** a `token_optimization_report.md` as part of every evaluation. If no optimization opportunities are found after running the full checklist, the report still exists and states that — providing a baseline for future comparisons.

**Severity classification** — for each item found, classify it as:
- **High** — pattern is confirmed present and exceeds a Rule C/E/F/N threshold
- **Medium** — pattern is present but below a hard threshold; warrants monitoring
- **Low** — pattern is marginal or applies only to low-frequency turn types
- **None found** — checklist item checked, no instance detected

**What to assess — optimization opportunity checklist:**

*Agent instructions (permanent cost — highest leverage):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Procedure steps that belong in tools** | Agent instructions contain step-by-step workflow logic (sequential steps, retry logic, error handling) that a tool could encapsulate | Move procedure body into the tool contract; reduce agent instructions to: trigger condition + tool name + result relay rule. For deterministic multi-step sequences specifically, choose the right mechanism: **`nextTool` chaining** (MCP `_meta.nextTool`) for straight-line ≤5-step Python sequences with no branches; **Agentic Workflow** (`@flow` / WxO Agentic Workflow JSON) for chains with conditional branches, parallel steps, cross-server tools, or >5 steps. Both remove the sequence prose from agent instructions entirely — the token saving equals the number of removed step-description lines × ~4 chars/token. |
| **Stateful protocol sections** | Agent instructions implement a counter, session flag, or multi-turn state machine inline (Rule A) | Move state tracking to a server-side variable, tool return field, or context variable; reduce instructions to a single check of that field |
| **Overcrowded tool-call contract sections** | Tool-call contract or parameter prose sections that duplicate what a tool schema already specifies | Reduce to trigger + relay rule only; move parameter detail to the tool schema or docstring |
| **Exact-phrase rules in agent instructions tied to backend hooks** | Prefix generation, sentinel detection, verbatim relay rules in the agent instructions that trigger a plugin hook | Move to pre/post invoke plugin; reduce agent instructions to a variable substitution or remove the rule entirely |
| **Redundant scope statements** | Agent instructions restate per-skill boundary conditions that are already in each skill's `description` frontmatter | Remove from agent instructions; the skill description is the authoritative scope statement for the agent |
| **Implicit state correction logic** | Agent instructions ask the LLM to review conversation history to self-correct a missed step (Rule A pattern) | Replace with a server-side counter surfaced as a tool return field; reduce agent instructions to forwarding the field value |

*Skill bodies (per-load cost):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Correlated sequential-load pairs** | Two skills confirmed to require sequential loads per SK-6/Rule M Trigger 1 or 2 | Consolidate into one skill; report estimated token reduction per affected turn |
| **Overlong catalog descriptions** | Any skill `description` that has grown into a paragraph of procedure (> ~3 sentences or >200 chars) | Trim to a routing signal: what intents it covers, what it does not — enough for load/no-load decision; move procedure detail into the skill body |
| **Oversized skill bodies** | Any skill body >100 lines (Rule E Trigger 1); especially >150 (Trigger 2) | Identify what inflates the body: classification tables, repeated preambles, inline decision trees, prohibited-phrase lists. Recommend moving each to tools or plugins |
| **Repeated base contract prose** | Same relay/handoff/end_session rules appear in multiple skill bodies AND are already stated in agent instructions | **Severity: Medium (not Low).** Duplication is not just a token cost — when skill bodies and agent instructions hold slightly different versions of the same rule, both are active in context simultaneously and can conflict. Divergence is a maintenance certainty, not a risk: any edit that updates one copy and misses the others silently introduces an in-context contradiction. Remove duplicated prose from skill bodies; keep the single authoritative version in agent instructions; estimate total lines × skill count savings |
| **Exact-phrase rules tied to backend systems** | Any rule requiring exact prefix generation, exact verbatim relay, or prohibited-phrase enforcement that drives a plugin hook | Move to pre/post invoke plugin; remove from LLM instruction path; report reliability gain as well as token saving |
| **LLM-side classification inside skill bodies** | Free-text-to-enum classification (e.g., reason codes, intent buckets, category fields) running inside the skill body, not via tool call | Externalize to a dedicated classification tool; removes classification table + tiebreaker prose from body |
| **Mandatory in-skill re-routing calls** | A skill body that re-calls a routing or classification tool for ambiguous inputs | After consolidation or body simplification, assess whether the re-route can be replaced by an inline decision rule |
| **Shared protocol duplication** | Multiple skill bodies each separately restate the same base relay or handoff protocol that is already stated once in agent instructions | **Severity: Medium (not Low).** Each per-skill copy is an independent maintenance surface — a future edit that updates the protocol in one skill but not the others creates in-context rule conflicts, not just dead weight. The correct fix is always a single authoritative statement in agent instructions; skill bodies may add only tool-specific detail (e.g., which named tool to call). Lift the shared protocol to agent instructions once; remove per-skill restatements |

**For each identified opportunity, report:**
1. **OPT-N label** — numbered optimization item (OPT-1, OPT-2, …)
2. **Location** — agent instructions or skill body (name)
3. **Current cost** — lines and estimated tokens consumed by this pattern today
4. **Root cause** — why the inflation exists (copy-paste, missing tool contract, coupling architecture, missing plugin, missing server-side state)
5. **Recommendation** — specific actionable change (move to tool, move to plugin, move to server-side state, consolidate skills, remove redundant prose)
6. **Projected saving** — estimated as a **percentage of the current component size** (not a rewrite): count the lines that could be removed, divide by the current total line count of that component, and express the saving as `~X% of [agent instructions / skill body / catalog]`. Then translate to tokens using `removable chars ÷ 4`. Report as: `~X lines (~Y% of current [N]-line [component]) → ~Z tokens saved per [turn type]`. Do not present as an absolute byte saving — the instructions are not being rewritten, so the percentage-of-current-size framing is more honest and easier to validate.
7. **Reliability benefit** — whether the change also reduces a Rule A/B/C/E/F signal (secondary gain beyond token reduction)

**Token estimation guidance — per-level scoping:**

Token costs are scoped to the context window where they are paid. Always report them by level, not as a flat sum.

- **Level 1 — Agent context (paid on every agent turn):**
  `instructions_est_tokens` + `skill_catalog_est_tokens` + `collaborator_routing_est_tokens` + `tool_list_est_tokens` + `tools_spec_est_tokens`
  - `skill_catalog_est_tokens` = sum of (name + description) for all skills — the agent needs all skill descriptions every turn to decide which skill to load
  - `collaborator_routing_est_tokens` = sum of (name + description) for all collaborators — routing signal only; collaborator internals are **not** in the supervisor's context
  - `tool_list_est_tokens` = sum of token cost of each agent-level tool name — always present for tool routing decisions
  - `tools_spec_est_tokens` = sum of spec body tokens for agent-level tools — present every turn with the tool schemas

- **Level 2 — Skill context (added on top of agent context when a skill is loaded):**
  `body_est_tokens` + skill's allowed-tool name tokens + skill's `allowed_tools_spec_est_tokens`
  - The skill's `allowed-tools` (names + schemas) are owned by the skill and injected **only** when that skill loads — they are **not** part of the agent's Level 1 floor
  - Only one skill body is active at a time; sequential skill loads replace the previous body

- **Level 3 — Collaborator context (separate LLM call, own context window):**
  A dispatched collaborator runs in its own context window with its own instructions, tools, and skills. These tokens are **entirely separate** from the supervisor's context — do not include them in the agent-level or skill-level totals.

`extract_agent_info.py` computes all of these automatically: `instructions_est_tokens`, `skill_catalog_est_tokens`, `collaborator_routing_est_tokens`, `tool_list_est_tokens`, `tools_spec_est_tokens` for the agent; per-skill `catalog_est_tokens`, `body_est_tokens`, `allowed_tools_spec_est_tokens`; per-collaborator `routing_est_tokens` and `instructions_est_tokens`. Use these values directly in the token budget table.

- State these estimates as approximations; exact values depend on the specific tokenizer and model

**Anti-patterns to document** (include in the report to guide future prompt authors):
- Procedure steps and tool-call contracts kept in agent instructions instead of tool schemas. For deterministic sequences (tool A always followed by tool B): move to `nextTool` chaining if ≤5 steps, single Python MCP server, branching (if any) is stable to hardcode, simple Q&A only, no transaction audit; move to Agentic Workflow if branch logic may evolve, multi-step user confirmation, cross-server tools, >5 steps, or transaction audit required. Every step removed from agent instructions is a per-turn token saving on every call.
- Implicit state correction logic asked of the LLM rather than tracked server-side
- **Copy-pasting base contract rules into new skill bodies** — every copy is an independent maintenance surface. When the same rule lives in both agent instructions and N skill bodies, any partial update silently introduces in-context conflicts: the LLM receives N+1 slightly-different versions of the same constraint simultaneously and cannot reliably resolve the contradiction. Single authoritative source in agent instructions; per-skill detail only in skill bodies
- LLM-side classification inside skill bodies (should be tool calls)
- Mid-body `load_skill` calls that cause instruction loss (remaining steps in the first skill become unreachable)
- Overlong skill descriptions that pay catalog tokens every turn for detail only needed after loading
- Inline exact-phrase contracts tied to backend system hooks
- Fallback skills with subjective boundaries that inflate load frequency
- Redundant scope statements in agent instructions that duplicate skill descriptions

**Report structure:** Follow Template 4 in `report-template.md`.

**What this rule does NOT do:**
- Does not re-score the five dimensions (the optimization report is a side report, not a re-evaluation)
- Does not recommend architectural changes unrelated to token cost (do not use this report to surface general achievability concerns already covered in the main reports)

**When no issues are found:** The report is still produced. Include the full checklist results showing "None found" for each pattern, state the current per-turn token budget as a baseline, and close with: "No token optimization opportunities were identified by static analysis. Re-run this evaluation after any significant change to agent instructions, skill bodies, or tool schemas."

## Rule P: Runtime performance optimization

**What this rule measures:** Whether the agent's execution architecture introduces avoidable runtime overhead in the form of unnecessary tool-call round-trips (RTTs), multi-hop LLM inference passes, deep orchestration layers, or coupled tool sequences that could be collapsed into deterministic pipelines. Where Rule O measures *instruction token cost*, Rule P measures *execution latency and call-graph depth* — the two compound each other but have different remedies.

**Two performance surfaces — always assess both:**

1. **Tool execution architecture:** How many LLM inference passes and tool-call RTTs does a typical turn require? Are there sequential tool calls that always fire together and could be merged, chained in a Python tool, or wrapped in an agentic workflow? Are there mandatory pre/post routing calls (e.g. a classification tool called on every turn) that add a deterministic hop regardless of intent complexity?

2. **Orchestration depth:** How many layers of agents, skills, and collaborators does a request traverse before reaching the tool that executes the actual work? Each additional layer (orchestrator → skill → sub-agent → tool) adds at least one LLM inference pass and one context-window write. Deeper stacks amplify latency variance.

**Always produce** a `performance_optimization_report.md` as part of every evaluation. If no performance optimization opportunities are found after running the full checklist, the report still exists and states that — providing a call-graph baseline for future comparisons.

**Severity classification** — for each item found, classify it as:
- **High** — pattern is confirmed and adds ≥1 RTT or inference hop to ≥20% of turns
- **Medium** — pattern adds overhead but only to a minority of turns, or the overhead is bounded
- **Low** — pattern is present but impact is marginal or limited to rare turn types
- **None found** — checklist item checked, no instance detected

**Deterministic sequence offload — two mechanisms:**

When agent instructions encode a sequence of tool calls that fires deterministically, that sequence can be moved out of the LLM reasoning path entirely. **This is not solely a performance optimisation.** When a confirmation step, an authorisation check, or any other mandatory gate is expressed only in agent instructions, it is subject to prompt injection and adversarial manipulation — a crafted user message can convince the LLM to skip or shortcut the step. Moving the sequence to `nextTool` chaining or an Agentic Workflow makes each transition structurally mandatory: the platform enforces it, and the LLM cannot reason around it regardless of what the user says. For any sequence that includes a high-stakes step (payment confirmation, fund transfer, account change, data deletion, authorisation check), offloading to a server-side mechanism is a **security requirement**, not just a latency improvement.

Two concrete mechanisms are available; choose based on the sequence's structural properties and long-term maintainability needs:

| Mechanism | What it is | Branching | User interaction | When to choose it | Token saving | Latency saving |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`nextTool` chaining** (`_meta.nextTool`) | An MCP tool returns `_meta: { nextTool: { tool, parameters } }` in its response; the platform invokes the next tool directly without an LLM pass. Chain is Python-only. Max recommended depth: 5. | **Supported** — a tool can conditionally emit different `_meta.nextTool` values based on its own result. **Trade-off:** branch logic is hardcoded inside the tool, coupling business rules to tool implementation. Any change to branching logic requires modifying and redeploying the tool, not just editing the flow definition. | **Simple Q&A only** — a tool can prompt for a single clarifying input before returning `nextTool`. Complex multi-step user confirmation flows are not supported. | Compact ≤5-step sequences within a single Python MCP server where branching logic is stable and unlikely to change, user interaction is simple Q&A at most, and no transaction audit/observability record is required per execution. | Removes the step sequence from agent instructions entirely; each removed step = ~20–50 tokens of instruction prose saved per load | Eliminates 1 LLM inference pass per chained step (each link that was previously a `next_action` deliberation pass becomes a direct server-side call; no model involved between steps) |
| **Agentic Workflow** (`@flow` / WxO Agentic Workflow JSON) | A flow tool or workflow node graph orchestrates the sequence server-side with explicit control-flow edges. Supports branching, parallel steps, conditional exits, user-interaction nodes, and multi-tool composition across different MCP servers. The LLM calls the entry node once and receives the final result. Built-in observability: each node transition emits execution events that are automatically captured in platform telemetry, making the full execution trace visible in monitoring and audit logs without additional instrumentation. | **Supported with externalised logic** — branching is expressed as explicit edges in the flow graph, not hardcoded inside tool implementations. Business logic changes are made in the flow definition without touching tool code. | **Full support** — workflow nodes can pause for rich user interaction (confirmations, choices, multi-field forms) and resume on response. | Sequences with complex or evolving branch logic; multi-step user confirmation flows; cross-server tool composition; >5 steps; transaction logic that must be audited or monitored per execution (payment, booking, cancellation, account change); or any sequence where the branching logic is expected to change over time. | Same — removes multi-step logic from instructions | Eliminates LLM deliberation between steps; each transition is a deterministic flow edge, not a model decision |

**Decision rule for recommending a mechanism:**
1. **Check for security-critical steps first.** If the sequence contains any high-stakes gate — payment confirmation, fund transfer, account modification, data deletion, authorisation check — the sequence **must** be offloaded to either `nextTool` chaining or an Agentic Workflow regardless of step count or branching complexity. Keeping it in agent instructions makes the gate prompt-injectable and adversarially skippable.
2. **Prefer Agentic Workflow when any of the following apply**, regardless of step count: branch logic is likely to change (business rules evolve); multi-step user confirmation or complex interaction required mid-sequence; transaction logic that needs an audit/observability record per execution; cross-server tools; >5 steps.
3. **`nextTool` chaining is appropriate when all of the following hold:** ≤5 steps; within a single Python MCP server; branching logic (if any) is stable and acceptable to hardcode in the tool; user interaction (if any) is simple single Q&A; no transaction audit requirement.
4. Both mechanisms eliminate the same root cause: LLM reasoning between steps of a deterministic sequence. The token saving (instruction prose removed) and inference-pass saving (no deliberation per step) are the same for both. The security gain — making mandatory gates structurally enforceable — applies equally to both.
5. When in doubt between the two, recommend Agentic Workflow — it externalises control flow from tool code, supports richer user interaction, and provides built-in observability at no additional instrumentation cost.

**What to assess — performance optimization checklist:**

*Tool execution architecture:*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Mandatory unconditional tool calls** | A tool is called on every turn regardless of intent (e.g. routing classification, context hydration, peek at pending state) | Evaluate whether the call can be eliminated by returning its output as a field in a prior tool response, or moved to a pre-invoke plugin that runs outside the LLM inference loop |
| **Fixed sequential tool chains** | Two or more tools are always called in the same order on the same turn type (e.g. tool A always followed by tool B with no branch) — the sequence is encoded in agent instructions, requiring an LLM deliberation pass between each step | Move the chain out of the LLM instruction path. Use **`nextTool` chaining** if: ≤5 steps, single Python MCP server, branching logic (if any) is stable enough to hardcode in the tool, user interaction is simple Q&A at most, no transaction audit requirement. Use **Agentic Workflow** if: branch logic may evolve, multi-step user confirmation needed, cross-server tools, >5 steps, or transaction audit required. The LLM makes one call and receives the final result; no reasoning between steps. |
| **`next_action` multi-hop dispatch** | A tool returns a `next_action` field that causes the agent to call another tool in the same turn, chaining N calls through LLM deliberation passes | Evaluate whether the entire chain can be offloaded. Use **`nextTool` chaining** if: straight-line or stable-branch, ≤5 steps, single Python MCP server, simple user interaction only, no transaction audit. Use **Agentic Workflow** if: branching logic is expected to change, multi-step user interaction, cross-server tools, >5 steps, or transaction audit required. In either case the LLM orchestrates only the entry point and receives the final result. |
| **LLM-side classification before tool call** | The agent must classify or route free text before deciding which tool to call (adds one deliberation pass) | Move classification to a classification tool or a pre-invoke plugin; the tool call becomes deterministic |
| **Correlated tool sets** | A set of tools is always called together across multiple skill bodies (appears in 3+ skills) | Evaluate whether the common set can be exposed as a single composed tool (Python chain or Agentic Workflow entry point), reducing the call count per turn |
| **Tool failure handling in-prompt** | The agent instructions describe what to do when a tool fails, errors, or times out — handled via LLM reasoning rather than tool contract | Move failure handling to the tool's error return schema or to an agentic workflow retry policy; remove from LLM instruction path |

*Orchestration depth and skill/collaborator architecture:*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Deep collaborator stack** | Agent → collaborator → sub-agent → tool (≥ 3 hops before reaching the executing tool) | Flatten: evaluate whether the intermediate layer adds routing value or merely proxies the request; merge collaborators whose scope is narrow |
| **Skill routing overhead** | Every intent requires a `load_skill` call before the domain tool can be called (adds one routing decision pass + context inject) | For high-frequency intents, evaluate whether the skill body can be collapsed into agent instructions directly, eliminating the load step; for low-frequency intents this trade-off reverses |
| **Redundant skill-level routing** | A skill body re-calls a classification or routing tool for ambiguous phrases (double routing: once at agent level, once inside skill) | After skill consolidation or body simplification, replace the in-skill re-route with a deterministic inline decision rule |
| **Collaborator over-specialization** | Many narrow collaborators each handle a single tool, when a small set of broader collaborators with richer tool access would cover the same domain with fewer hops | Consolidate collaborators that cover adjacent intents and share tool dependencies; target ≤ 1 LLM hop between orchestrator and executing tool for the most frequent intents |

*Guidelines overhead:*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Guidelines restating agent instructions** | Guidelines duplicate rules already in the `instructions:` field | Remove duplicates from guidelines; each guideline is evaluated as an additional constraint pass at inference time |
| **Guidelines expressing tool-call rules** | A guideline says "when X, call tool Y" — a rule that belongs in the instructions as an explicit trigger, or in the tool contract as a precondition | Move tool-call rules to instructions or tool schema; guidelines are best for behavioral guardrails (tone, safety, scope), not execution logic |
| **High guideline count** | ≥ 5 guidelines each add constraint-check overhead on every turn, even when most are irrelevant to the current intent | Evaluate each guideline: can it be merged with a related instruction rule, expressed as a tool precondition, or removed because it duplicates an existing constraint? Target ≤ 3 execution-relevant guidelines |
| **Guidelines with complex conditions** | A guideline's condition is itself a multi-clause if/then (e.g. "if the customer has said X and the journey is in state Y and tool Z has been called") | Decompose into an explicit instruction rule with a named state variable, or encode as a tool precondition; complex guideline conditions are evaluated as additional branch nodes per turn |

*Knowledge base and retrieval risk (token cost + latency):*

Large KB payloads have **two compounding effects**: they inflate the input token count for that turn (Rule O cost), and they directly increase inference latency because the model must process a larger context window on every pass that follows the retrieval call. Both effects apply to every call — they are not separate or optional to assess.

| Pattern | Check | Token impact | Latency impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **KB-like tool present** | Any tool whose name or description suggests retrieval (`search`, `query`, `retrieve`, `lookup`, `knowledge`, `kb`, `rag`, `find`, `fetch`, `document`, `semantic`) — or `kind: knowledge_base` in a resolved YAML | Flag the tool as a retrieval surface; apply the checks below | Each retrieval call adds one tool RTT |
| **Unconstrained passage count** | No explicit `top_k`, `max_results`, `limit`, or equivalent in instructions or tool definition; or instructions say "all relevant", "full context", or specify > 5 passages | High token risk if called on high-frequency intents; Medium if limit > 5 | High latency risk — large payload forces the LLM to process a much wider context on every subsequent inference pass in the same turn; attention quality degrades as retrieved content pushes instructions toward context edges |
| **High KB call frequency** | KB called unconditionally on every turn, or referenced in agent instructions (not scoped to a specific skill) | Permanent per-turn token overhead | RTT + processing overhead on every call |
| **Multiple KB calls per turn** | Two or more retrieval calls in a single turn workflow | Additive payload: N passages × K calls | Each call is a separate RTT; total latency = sum of all retrieval RTTs + enlarged context processing time for subsequent inference passes |
| **KB in high-frequency skill** | Retrieval tool in a skill body loaded on most turns (per SK-7 load frequency) | Compounds with skill body cost on every load | Skill load + retrieval RTT + enlarged context processing = three compounding latency sources on most turns |

**How to assess passage count without runtime access (static inference):**
- If the tool definition is available (via `extract_tool_info.py`) and has a `top_k` or `max_results` parameter with a default or a value set in the instructions, use that value.
- If no limit is stated, treat the effective passage count as **unknown / potentially unbounded** and flag as High.
- Passage token cost is a **runtime variable** — chunk size is configured in the knowledge base, not in the agent instructions, and is not visible from static analysis. Use ≥500 tokens/passage as a conservative lower bound. Typical range is 500–1,500 tokens/passage. At 5 passages × 500 tokens = ~2,500 additional context tokens per call (lower bound); at 1,500 tokens/passage = ~7,500 tokens.
- Always state this estimate as an approximation and note it cannot be fully verified without runtime inspection. Recommend the author confirm the knowledge base chunk size configuration.
- **Latency implication of large payloads:** input-token processing time scales with context size. A turn that injects 5,000+ tokens of retrieval content into context will process measurably slower than one injecting 500 tokens, even holding inference hops constant. Report this as a latency signal alongside the token cost signal — they have the same root cause (unconstrained or high-frequency retrieval) and the same remedy.

*Cross-cutting (token cost × latency):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **High token cost on mandatory turns** | The per-turn token cost from Rule O/N is Medium or High, and those tokens appear on every turn (agent instructions) | Token reduction from Rule O directly reduces input processing latency; reference Rule O recommendations and their latency impact |
| **Large skill bodies on high-frequency intents** | The most-loaded skill bodies belong to the agent's highest-volume intents | Token reduction for those specific skill bodies (Rule O) has disproportionate latency impact; prioritize them first |
| **Knowledge base retrieval on high-frequency intents** | A KB / retrieval tool is called on turns that form a large share of overall traffic, with an unconstrained or large passage count | Cross-reference the KB token risk item above; this is the highest-leverage retrieval optimization opportunity — reducing `top_k` or restricting query scope saves tokens on the most-frequent turns |

**For each identified opportunity, report:**
1. **PERF-N label** — numbered performance item (PERF-1, PERF-2, …)
2. **Category** — tool execution / orchestration depth / guidelines / KB retrieval / token×latency
3. **Severity** — High / Medium / Low (see severity classification above)
4. **Current cost** — RTTs added, inference passes added, or tokens on mandatory turns
5. **Frequency** — % of turns affected, or "every turn" / "conditional on [trigger]"
6. **Root cause** — why the overhead exists (missing tool composition, missing agentic workflow, over-decomposed collaborators, guidelines duplication)
7. **Recommendation** — specific actionable change: Python tool chain, agentic workflow wrap, collaborator consolidation, guideline removal/relocation, pre-invoke plugin migration
8. **Mechanism** — *how* the recommendation reduces latency: fewer RTTs, fewer LLM inference passes, fewer context-window writes, or reduced per-turn token cost
9. **Estimated impact** — RTTs eliminated per affected turn type, or % turns affected
10. **Cross-report** — OPT-N (token saving) / REL-N (reliability signal resolved) / No cross-report overlap

**Latency model guidance:**
- Each LLM inference pass adds ~500ms–2s latency (varies by model size and load); treat as one "inference hop"
- Each synchronous tool-call RTT adds ~50ms–500ms (varies by tool complexity and network); treat as one "tool hop"
- Context-window write (skill load, collaborator handoff) adds one inference hop plus token processing overhead
- **Large retrieval payload:** input-token processing time scales with context size — injecting 5,000+ retrieval tokens into context measurably increases per-pass latency beyond what inference hop count alone predicts. Treat as an additional latency multiplier on any turn where a KB call fires with a large or unconstrained passage count.
- Per-turn latency ≈ (inference hops × inference latency) + (tool hops × tool latency) + (token count × processing rate)
- State these estimates as approximations; actual values require production profiling

**Anti-patterns to document** (include in the report to guide future agent architects):
- Routing classification called unconditionally on every turn instead of being absorbed into prior tool output or a pre-invoke plugin
- `next_action` multi-hop chains that are never short-circuited — every turn traverses the full chain even when the answer is deterministic
- Collaborator stacks with 3+ hops where each intermediate layer adds no domain routing value
- Guidelines used to express tool-call logic (execution branching), causing the LLM to evaluate tool routing as a constraint rather than as an instruction
- Skill load required for every intent when high-frequency intents could bypass the skill layer via direct agent-instruction handling
- Correlated tool sets called in N separate LLM turns when they could be composed into a single deterministic tool
- Knowledge base or retrieval tool called with no passage-count limit — unbounded retrieval injects an unknown and potentially very large token payload into context on every call, and forces the LLM to process a much larger context window on every inference pass in that turn
- KB called unconditionally on every turn when a conditional trigger or intent-scoped query would serve the same purpose with a fraction of the payload and latency
- Large retrieval payload treated as a token problem only — it is also a latency problem; both dimensions must be reported together

**Relationship to Rule O (token optimization):**
Rule O and Rule P are complementary but distinct. Rule O targets instruction token cost — the input the LLM must process before generating a response. Rule P targets execution call-graph depth — the number of round-trips and inference passes per turn. Both compound latency, but their remedies differ: Rule O remedies reduce tokens; Rule P remedies reduce hops. A complete performance analysis runs both. When Rule O recommendations also reduce hops (e.g. moving logic to a tool removes both tokens and a deliberation pass), flag the dual benefit in both reports.

**Report structure:** Follow Template 5 in `report-template.md`.

**What this rule does NOT do:**
- Does not re-score the five evaluation dimensions (side report only)
- Does not cover token cost in detail — that is Rule O's scope; reference Rule O for token-specific recommendations
- Does not prescribe specific tool implementation details (Python vs. REST vs. agentic workflow) — recommend the appropriate pattern and explain why; the implementor chooses the concrete technology

**When no issues are found:** The report is still produced. Include the full checklist results showing "None found" for each pattern, present the current call-graph baseline, and close with: "No runtime performance optimization opportunities were identified by static analysis. Re-run this evaluation after any significant change to tool schemas, skill architecture, or guidelines."

## Rule Q: Reliability optimization

**What this rule measures:** Whether the agent's design contains patterns that produce systematic, repeatable compliance failures at runtime — failures that occur not randomly but predictably, for specific turn types, because the instructions structurally cannot be followed reliably. Where Rule O targets token cost and Rule P targets execution depth, Rule Q targets **instruction-level fragility**: the patterns that cause the agent to consistently produce wrong, missing, or corrupted output for identifiable classes of input.

Rule Q is distinct from the five achievability dimensions: the main evaluation scores *what* the achievability risk is; Rule Q identifies *specific rewrite actions* that eliminate the highest-confidence failure sources, grouped by the class of fix rather than by dimension.

**Always produce** a `reliability_optimization_report.md` as part of every evaluation. If no reliability optimization opportunities are found after running the full checklist, the report still exists and states that — providing a stability baseline for future comparisons.

**Severity classification** — for each item found, classify it as:
- **Critical** — the pattern will produce a wrong or missing output on a predictable, non-trivial fraction of production turns; no workaround exists inside the current instruction design
- **High** — the pattern produces compliance failures under specific but commonly encountered conditions (e.g. multi-intent turns, adversarial phrasing, edge-of-scope inputs)
- **Medium** — the pattern is a known fragility that will cause occasional failures; manageable with targeted rewrite
- **Low** — marginal risk; failure mode is rare or recoverable
- **None found** — checklist item checked, no instance detected

**What to assess — reliability optimization checklist:**

*Implicit state and counters (Rule A patterns):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM-side attempt counter** | Instructions ask the LLM to count missed calls, retry attempts, or clarification turns from conversation history | Move counter to server-side state or tool return field; agent reads a field value, never counts |
| **Cross-turn "already asked" memory** | Instructions say "never ask X twice" or "remember if the user already provided Y" without an explicit context variable | Add a boolean context variable set by the tool response; instructions check the variable |
| **Journey step tracking** | Agent must infer which step of a multi-step journey it is on from conversation history rather than a server-returned `current_state` | Ensure the journey tool always returns `current_state`; instructions branch on the field value, not on history review |

*Exact-phrase and verbatim requirements (Rule B patterns):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Verbatim relay with backend hook** | A prefix, sentinel string, or exact body text the LLM must produce triggers a plugin, backend system, or downstream formatter | Move production to the plugin layer; LLM produces variable content, plugin adds the exact framing |
| **Prohibited-phrase enforcement** | Instructions list N phrases the LLM must never include in a specific response type; enforcement is entirely LLM-side | Move to post-invoke plugin text filter; the filter is deterministic, the LLM is not |
| **Enum classification without tool** | LLM must classify free text to a fixed enum (e.g. `reason_a \| reason_b \| other`) inside the instruction body; no tool validates the output | Externalize to a classification tool or routing tool enrichment field that returns and validates the enum value |

*Scope and routing fragility (Rule I/J patterns):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Tense-based or phrasing-dependent routing boundary** | Two skills or two intents are distinguished by grammatical tense, a single keyword, or phrase form rather than semantic intent | Replace with a CAUSE-based or object-based boundary; add explicit disambiguation examples; add a fallback tool call for ambiguous cases |
| **Subjective "last resort" fallback** | A skill or handler is described as "use when nothing else applies" without an explicit exclusion list | Add an explicit exclusion list enumerating what this skill does NOT cover; transforms a judgment-based rule to a deterministic boundary |
| **Overlapping skill descriptions** | Two skills have descriptions that cover the same user intent; routing to the correct skill requires contextual judgment that was not present at routing time | Resolve overlap: either merge the skills or rewrite one description to explicitly exclude the shared edge case |

*Conflicting and competing rules (Rule A/F patterns):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Same-turn dual-field distinction** | Agent must simultaneously distinguish two similarly named fields from different sources (e.g. `action_required` vs `action_should_be_offered`) and take opposite actions depending on which is true | Sequence the checks explicitly: check field A first; only if A is false, check field B. Or consolidate into a single action-type enum at the tool layer |
| **Competing output format rules** | Instructions specify both a short-response rule (e.g. "max 2 sentences") and a verbatim relay rule (e.g. "relay the tool's response text literally") — one will be violated when the tool response is long | Explicitly prioritize: verbatim relay overrides length limits; or note the exception case |
| **Double-negative fill conditions** | A fill/no-fill rule uses a double negative: "fill only when NOT condition_A AND NOT condition_B" — cognitively dense and error-prone | Rewrite as a positive condition: "fill only when [positive state is true]" |

*Underspecified tool behavior (Rule D patterns):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Missing failure handling** | A tool call has no documented failure path in the instructions — no guidance on what to do if the tool returns an error, times out, or returns unexpected output | Add a 1-line failure handler per tool: "if tool unavailable or returns error → [specific action]"; or document this in the tool's error return schema |
| **Undeclared context variable** | Instructions reference a context variable (e.g. `user_context`, `channel`) that is not declared in the YAML `context_variables:` list | Declare the variable in `context_variables:` or document explicitly that it is injected by a pre-invoke plugin |
| **`next_action` value not fully enumerated** | A dispatch table handles N named `next_action` values but does not specify what to do when an unexpected value is returned (no-match case) | Add an explicit no-match handler: "if `next_action` value is not in the table → call the tool again without changes" or "→ offer handoff" |

*Skill body–specific reliability (SK-5 patterns):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **Skill body exceeds followability threshold** | A skill body triggers Rule E Trigger 2 (>150 lines) or Rule F high range (>10 active rules/turn) | Decompose: identify the 2–3 sub-sections driving line count; move each to a tool, plugin, or separate skill |
| **Multi-workflow skill (SK-1 Warn/Fail)** | A skill body contains 2+ distinct primary workflows with different output contracts (e.g. verbatim relay AND free synthesis) | Split into two skills, one per workflow, with non-overlapping `description` frontmatter |
| **Cross-skill state assumption (SK-4 Warn/Fail)** | A skill body assumes state, tool output, or a routing decision that could only come from another skill having already run | Remove the assumption; make the skill independently executable by adding a check-and-call for any prerequisite state |

*Workflow encoding and instruction-layer security (Rule C/F patterns):*

| Pattern | Check | Optimization action |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM-orchestrated multi-step chain** | Instructions contain a `next_action` dispatch table (or equivalent) driving 3+ sequential tool calls where each step follows deterministically from the previous one — a sequence with known transitions and known exit conditions | Move the control plane out of the LLM reasoning path. Use **`nextTool` chaining** (`_meta.nextTool`) if: ≤5 steps, single Python MCP server, branching logic (if any) is stable and acceptable to hardcode in the tool, user interaction is simple Q&A at most, no transaction audit requirement. Use **Agentic Workflow** (`@flow` / WxO Agentic Workflow JSON) if: branch logic may evolve, multi-step user confirmation needed, cross-server tools, >5 steps, or transaction audit/observability required. Both mechanisms eliminate the same compound error risk: each probabilistic step in a multi-step LLM-orchestrated chain can fail independently, errors accumulate — moving the chain server-side makes every transition guaranteed. See Rule P "Deterministic sequence offload" for the full decision table. |
| **Instruction-only confirmation gate on high-stakes operation** | A confirmation step, authorisation check, or mandatory user approval before a high-stakes operation (payment, fund transfer, account modification, data deletion, privilege escalation) is expressed solely as a rule in agent instructions or a skill body — not enforced by the tool chain itself | **Severity: Critical.** Instruction-layer gates are prompt-injectable: a crafted user message or adversarial prompt can convince the LLM that the confirmation was already given, is unnecessary in this context, or should be skipped. The gate may reliably fire under normal conditions and still be bypassable under adversarial ones. Fix: move the confirmation step into the tool chain (`nextTool` sequence or Agentic Workflow node) so the platform enforces it structurally. The LLM cannot reason around a server-side transition. Cross-report: also a PERF-N item (removes an instruction-side deliberation pass) and an OPT-N item (removes the confirmation prose from the instruction surface). |

**For each identified opportunity, report:**
1. **REL-N label** — numbered reliability item (REL-1, REL-2, …)
2. **Category** — implicit state / exact-phrase / scope-routing / conflicting rules / tool underspecification / skill body / workflow encoding / instruction-layer security
3. **Severity** — Critical / High / Medium / Low (see severity classification above)
4. **Current cost** — the specific wrong output or compliance failure this pattern produces (what goes wrong, under what conditions)
5. **Frequency** — estimated fraction of production turns where this failure will manifest (e.g. "every first turn", "~15% of turns requiring multi-step confirmation", "rare — only on neutral-phrasing edge cases")
6. **Evidence** — direct quote from agent instructions or skill body; line number if available; non-English quotes must include `[Translation]`
7. **Root cause** — why the design produces this failure (missing state object / missing plugin / missing tool contract / overlapping descriptions / competing rules)
8. **Recommendation** — specific rewrite: what to change, where, and what the result should look like
9. **Estimated impact** — what fraction of turns this fix improves and how; cross-reference the Frequency above
10. **Cross-report** — OPT-N (token saving) / PERF-N (hop eliminated) / No cross-report overlap

**Relationship to main evaluation reports:**
- Rule Q does not re-score the five dimensions — that is the main agent/skill reports' job. Rule Q takes the findings *from* those reports and synthesises them into a single, prioritised, implementation-ready rewrite plan.
- Every REL-N item must trace back to at least one finding or signal in the main agent report or a skill report. Rule Q is a synthesis document, not an independent analysis.
- Findings already addressed by Rule O (token reduction) or Rule P (hop reduction) should cross-reference those items when the fix overlaps (e.g. "moving a classification step to a tool also reduces the skill body size — see OPT-N and PERF-N").

**Anti-patterns to document** (include in the report to guide future prompt authors):
- LLM asked to count or remember across turns without external state
- Exact-phrase requirements whose correctness drives a backend system — these belong in the plugin layer
- Routing boundaries defined by grammatical form (tense, pronoun) rather than semantic intent
- Competing rules stated at the same priority level without an explicit sequencing rule
- Tool dispatch tables with no no-match handler — every dispatch table needs an explicit default case
- Skills with multiple output contracts (verbatim vs. synthesized) — one skill, one contract
- Undeclared context variables that are assumed to be available at runtime
- Multi-step deterministic sequences (3+ steps, known transitions, known exits) implemented as LLM-orchestrated dispatch tables — every link is a probabilistic decision; compound errors accumulate; move the control plane server-side: use `nextTool` chaining (`_meta.nextTool`) if ≤5 steps, single Python MCP server, branching (if any) is stable enough to hardcode, and no transaction audit required; use Agentic Workflow if branch logic may evolve, multi-step user confirmation needed, cross-server tools, >5 steps, or transaction observability required
- **Instruction-only confirmation gates on high-stakes operations** — any confirmation step, authorisation check, or mandatory user approval that is expressed only in agent instructions is prompt-injectable. Under normal conditions the gate fires correctly; under adversarial prompting the LLM can be convinced the confirmation was already given, is inapplicable in the current context, or should be skipped. A gate that is merely requested by the instructions is not the same as a gate that is structurally enforced by the platform. Move all high-stakes gates into the tool chain (`nextTool` sequence or Agentic Workflow node); the platform transition is not subject to LLM reasoning.

**Report structure:** Follow Template 6 in `report-template.md`.

**What this rule does NOT do:**
- Does not re-score the five evaluation dimensions (side report only)
- Does not introduce new findings — every REL-N item must trace back to evidence already in the main reports
- Does not duplicate Rule O or Rule P recommendations — when a fix reduces both reliability and token cost or hops, note the cross-reference but do not re-explain the full recommendation

**When no issues are found:** The report is still produced. Include the full checklist results showing "None found" for each pattern, and close with: "No reliability optimization opportunities were identified by static analysis. The current design avoids all known systematic failure patterns. Re-run this evaluation after any significant change to agent instructions, skill bodies, or tool schemas."

## How to apply these rules

1. **Count the signals:** Extract exact counts for exact phrases, nested branches, active operational rules per turn, implicit state variables, and underspecified tools. **For agents with skills, repeat this count for each skill body (SK-5), perform overlap analysis across all skill descriptions (SK-2), identify correlated pairs (SK-6/Rule M), and compute the full performance surface (SK-7/Rule N). After all main reports are complete, synthesise the three side reports: Rule O (token optimization), Rule P (performance optimization), and Rule Q (reliability optimization) — all three are always produced.**

2. **Apply the bounds:** Use the thresholds above to establish scoring bounds (e.g., "State & Conflict Manageability should not exceed 2"). **When SK rules trigger, apply their bounds to the corresponding agent-level dimensions. When Rules M and N trigger, apply their risk ratings to the Runtime Performance Risk section.**

3. **Use judgment within bounds:** The bounds are not automatic scores. Use your judgment to score within the bounded range based on the full context.

4. **Explain the reasoning:** In your findings, cite both the deterministic signal (e.g., "20+ exact phrases") and the judgment-based conclusion (e.g., "this creates high brittleness because...").

5. **Do not fabricate counts:** If you cannot confidently count a signal, mark it as "unknown" and explain why. Do not guess.

## Confidence impact

When deterministic signals are counted manually (Direct Analysis Mode):
- **High confidence:** Signals that are easy to count accurately (e.g., exact phrases with "EXACTLY" keyword)
- **Medium confidence:** Signals that require interpretation (e.g., nested branches, implicit state variables)
- **Low confidence:** Signals that are ambiguous or context-dependent (e.g., subjective classifiers)

Always state your confidence level and explain what would improve it (e.g., "Confidence would be higher with automated extraction tool").
