# Report Template Structure

This file defines **nine templates** that together form the **complete report set** produced for every evaluation.

> ⚠️ **The seven core reports (Templates 1–7) are mandatory.** Collaborator reports (Template 8) and the extracted JSON snapshot (Template 9) are conditional — produced only when the agent has resolved collaborators. An evaluation that omits any applicable file is incomplete.

## Required report set

| # | Template | Filename | Mandatory? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Agent report | `agent_<name>_report.md` + `agent_<name>_report_harness.json` | ✓ Always |
| 2 | Skill report (one per skill) | `skill_<skill-name>_report.md` + `skill_<skill-name>_report_harness.json` | ✓ Always — one per resolved skill |
| 3 | Index | `index.md` | ✓ Always — written last |
| 4 | Token optimization report | `token_optimization_report.md` | ✓ Always — even if no issues found |
| 5 | Performance optimization report | `performance_optimization_report.md` | ✓ Always — even if no issues found |
| 6 | **Reliability optimization report** | **`reliability_optimization_report.md`** | ✓ **Always — even if no issues found** |
| 7 | Rules reference copy | `rules-summary.md` | ✓ Always — copied from skill directory |
| 8 | Collaborator report (one per resolved collaborator at any depth) | `collaborator_<name>_report.md` + `collaborator_<name>_report_harness.json` | ✓ Conditional — one per resolved collaborator; omit only when the agent has no collaborators |
| 9 | Extracted agent JSON snapshot | `agent_<name>_extracted.json` | ✓ Conditional — required when `extract_agent_info.py` was run; omit only when the agent was evaluated without the extraction script |

> **Collaborator reports are mandatory deliverables whenever collaborators are present.** They are not optional depth-N output — they are the primary deliverable for each collaborator's CO-1 through CO-7 analysis. Every resolved collaborator at every depth level gets its own report file, written flat into the same `eval/` directory. The depth and parent context are encoded inside the report's header metadata, not in the file path.

All files go in `eval/` relative to the agent YAML's directory. Each report is saved to disk as soon as it is complete. Skill reports are produced in **batches of at most 2 at a time** — complete and save 2 skill reports before starting the next pair. Do not evaluate all skills in parallel.

**Writing order:**
1. Agent report (first — establishes cross-skill and cross-collaborator context)
2. Collaborator reports, depth-first (one per resolved collaborator; include extracted JSON per collaborator if available)
3. Skill reports in batches of 2
4. Token optimization report (Template 4)
5. Performance optimization report (Template 5)
6. **Reliability optimization report (Template 6) — do not skip**
7. Index (last — references all of the above)

## Template 1: Agent Report

```markdown
# Agent Prompt Achievability Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Disclaimer

**This evaluation is subjective and based on the evaluating LLM's interpretation of its own ability to understand and follow the instructions.** The scores, findings, and recommendations should be treated as **indicative guidance** rather than absolute metrics. Different LLM models, versions, or instances may interpret the same instructions differently and achieve varying levels of compliance.

**Key limitations:**
- Scores reflect estimated achievability based on known LLM attention patterns and empirical thresholds, not guaranteed outcomes
- The evaluation cannot predict actual runtime behavior across all possible user inputs and contexts
- Tool grounding assessments are limited by the availability of formal tool definitions in the evaluation input
- Findings are based on manual analysis and may not capture all edge cases or interactions

**Recommended use:**
- Use this report as a diagnostic tool to identify high-risk areas in prompt design
- Validate findings through empirical testing with the target LLM in production-like conditions
- Prioritize changes based on severity and operational impact, not just scores
- Re-evaluate after making significant changes to instructions or tooling

### Main performance risk drivers
- [List the signals that drive runtime cost, e.g. prompt length, ambiguous tool triggers, interacting constraints, correlated skill pairs, large skill bodies]

### Skill architecture performance surface (omit section if no skills)
| Component | Measured value | Risk rating |
|---|---|---|
| Skill count | [N] | [Low / Medium / High] |
| Per-skill body size (max / avg lines) | [X / Y lines] | [Low / Medium / High] |
| Routing ambiguity (plausible candidates/turn) | [N] | [Low / Medium / High] |
| Load transitions per turn (est. `load_skill` calls for multi-step intents) | [N] | [Low / Medium / High] |
| Re-load frequency (confirmed same-skill reload in one turn) | [Yes / No] | [Medium if Yes / Low if No] |
| Per-load token cost (largest skill body likely loaded) | [~N tokens] | [Low / Medium / High] |
| **Overall skill-load overhead** | | **[Low / Medium / High]** |

### Correlated skill pairs (omit if none found)
| Skill A | Skill B | Correlation type | Consolidation recommended? |
|---|---|---|---|
| [skill-name] | [skill-name] | [Adjacent intents / Mid-body load_skill reference] | [Yes — reason / No] |

### SK-6 Tool-shadowing analysis

> **Platform model:** Every tool any skill uses must be declared in `agent tools:` (the authoritative registry). A skill's `allowed-tools` restricts which declared tools are visible inside the skill. A skill-filtered tool is callable only while that skill is active — it is permanently unavailable at the agent's base level.

**Trigger 3 — Agent instructions reference a skill-filtered tool (omit block if none found)**
| Tool | Referenced in agent instructions/guidelines? | In `shadowed_resolved_tools`? | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| [tool-name] | Yes — "[quote from instructions]" | Yes | Agent cannot call [tool-name] at base level — silent execution gap (High) |

**Trigger 3a — Zero-tool base coverage (omit if `active_resolved_tools` is non-empty)**
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `active_resolved_tools` (tools callable at agent base level) | [list, or "empty"] |
| Explicit skill-only confirmation in agent instructions? | [Yes — confirmed, no note needed / Not found — raise intentionality note] |

> **Note:** Zero-tool base coverage is a valid design for a pure skill-routing agent. This check only asks whether the choice is intentional. It does not lower any dimension score.

**Trigger 3b — Skill-only tools (informational)**
| Tool | Skill(s) filtering it | Referenced in agent instructions? | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| [tool-name] | [skill-name(s)] | No | Skill-only — no execution gap; agent never intended to call at base level |

### Performance interpretation
[Short paragraph explaining whether instruction complexity is likely to increase runtime cost, latency, tool-call count, or response variance. Distinguish deterministic evidence from judgment-based conclusions. When skills are present, include: expected per-turn skill-load cost, whether any skill pairs require sequential loads in the same turn, and whether the skill architecture as a whole adds measurable latency overhead.]

## Skill Health Summary (omit section if no skills)

> Per-skill dimension scores and deep analysis appear in individual skill reports. This table is a cross-skill health overview. SK-2 (overlap), SK-3 hard-limit failures, and SK-6 Trigger 3 findings have direct impact on the agent's five dimension scores. SK-6 Trigger 3a (zero-tool base coverage) is an intentionality check only — it never lowers a dimension score. All other SK findings are contained in the per-skill reports.

### Skill Health Summary Table
| Skill | SK-1 | SK-2 | SK-3 | SK-4 | SK-5 | SK-6 | SK-7 | SK-8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [skill-name] | [P/W/F] | [P/W/F] | [P/W/F — incl. hard-limit] | [P/W/F] | [P/W/F] | [P/W/F — T3 gap / W — T3a] | [P/W/F] | [P/W/F] |

> P = Pass, W = Warn, F = Fail. SK-6 rating key: **F** = Trigger 3 violation (agent instructions reference a skill-filtered tool — deterministic execution gap); **N** (note) = Trigger 3a only (zero `active_resolved_tools`, unconfirmed — valid design; intentionality note only, no score impact); **P** = neither T3 nor T3a (or T3a confirmed). Hard-limit failures in SK-3 are marked F. SK-2 Exact/High failures are marked F. Trigger 3b (skill-only tools, not referenced in agent text) does NOT produce a Fail, Warn, or Note.

**Rating guide:**
- **Pass**: No issue detected
- **Warn**: Potential issue; monitor or improve before production scale
- **Fail**: Definite issue that will cause reliability or performance problems at production load

**Agent dimension impact from skill findings:**
- **SK-2 Exact/High** → lowers agent Dimension 2 (Scope & Applicability): ambiguous routing
- **SK-3 Fail (hard limit)** → lowers agent Dimension 3 (Execution & Tool Grounding): skill is unreachable
- **SK-6 Trigger 3** (agent `instructions:`/`guidelines:` references a skill-filtered tool) → lowers agent Dimension 3 (Execution & Tool Grounding): **High severity** — deterministic silent execution gap per affected tool; fix required
- **SK-6 Trigger 3a** (zero `active_resolved_tools`) → **no dimension score impact**; intentionality note only; valid design for a pure skill-routing agent; raise a lightweight note if unconfirmed
- **SK-6 Trigger 3b** (skill-only tools, not referenced in agent text) → **informational only**, no dimension impact
- **All other SK Fails** → contained in per-skill reports; do not affect agent dimension scores

### Cross-skill overlap pairs (SK-2)
| Skill A | Skill B | Overlap rating | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| [skill-name] | [skill-name] | [Exact/High/Moderate/Low] | [quoted text from both descriptions] |

### Consolidation recommendations (SK-6)
For each pair meeting the consolidation trigger threshold (SK-2 Moderate/High overlap + co-occurring intents, OR mid-body `load_skill` creating sequential dependency):

**[Skill A] + [Skill B] → consolidate into [suggested-name]**
- **Why**: [overlapping intents / mid-body load_skill reference — cite evidence]
- **Performance implication**: Sequential loads (A then B) add one extra `load_skill` call per turn — each call replaces the active body. For a workload of [N] turns/hour where [X%] require both, this adds [estimate] overhead per hour.
- **How to consolidate**: [Merge strategy: union the `allowed-tools` lists, merge the body sections, deduplicate rules, update the `description` to cover both intent sets and their combined boundary conditions]

### Skill health findings (agent-visible issues only)
[For SK-2, SK-3 hard-limit, or SK-6 Trigger 3 (agent instruction references skill-filtered tool) Fail ratings, produce a full finding: Evidence (quote the agent instruction and name the tool + skill), Why it matters, Deterministic or judgment-based, Agent dimension impact, Recommended change. For SK-6 Trigger 3a (zero `active_resolved_tools`, unconfirmed), produce a lightweight intentionality note — not a scored finding, no dimension impact — asking the author to confirm pure skill-routing intent. For SK-6 Trigger 3b (skill-only tools) produce an informational note only. For all other Warn/Fail ratings, note: "See [skill_X_report.md] for full analysis."]

## Template 4: Token Optimization Report

Use this structure for `token_optimization_report.md`. This report is **always produced** as part of every evaluation — it does not re-score the five evaluation dimensions.

**Coverage:** This report covers **three optimization surfaces**:
- **Agent instructions** — loaded on every turn; reductions here save tokens universally
- **Skill catalog** (all skill names + descriptions) — loaded on every turn regardless of which skill is active; overlong descriptions waste catalog tokens for detail that is only useful after loading
- **Skill bodies** — loaded per intent, one at a time; reductions here save tokens on the affected turn types

**When no issues are found:** still produce the full report. Use "None found" for each checklist item, include the current token budget table as a baseline, omit the OPT-N inventory section (or include it with a single "No opportunities identified" note), and close the report with the standard baseline statement.

```markdown
# Token Consumption Optimization Report
## [Agent Name]

> Side report to: [agent_<name>_report.md](agent_<name>_report.md)
> See also: [performance_optimization_report.md](performance_optimization_report.md) · [reliability_optimization_report.md](reliability_optimization_report.md)
> Generated: [date]
> Scope: Token and reasoning overhead across agent instructions + [N] skill bodies

---

## Purpose

[1–2 sentences stating the optimization goal. Note the original baseline token cost if a prior version exists, and the current per-turn cost range. Distinguish the two optimization surfaces: agent instructions (paid every turn) vs. skill bodies (paid per load).]

---

## Current State Baseline

### Token Budget (per turn, estimated)

> Token estimates use **character count ÷ 4** (≈4 chars/token). `extract_agent_info.py` computes these automatically — use the reported values directly. Token costs are **scoped per level** — report each level separately, never sum across levels.

#### Level 1 — Agent context (paid on every agent turn)

| Component | Chars | Est. Tokens | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Agent instructions | [N] | ~[N] (`instructions_est_tokens`) | Always |
| Skill catalog — names + descriptions (N skills) | [N] | ~[N] (`skill_catalog_est_tokens`) | Always — agent needs all skill descriptions to decide which skill to load |
| Collaborator routing — names + descriptions (N collabs) | [N] | ~[N] (`collaborator_routing_est_tokens`) | Always — routing signal only; collaborator internals are in their own context |
| Agent tool list — names only (N active tools) | [N] | ~[N] (`tool_list_est_tokens`) | Active tools only — shadowed tools excluded (platform removes them from base set) |
| Agent tool specs — schemas (N active tools) | [N] | ~[N] (`tools_spec_est_tokens`) | Active tools only — shadowed tools not loaded at L1 |
| [Any mandatory pre-routing tool call] | — | ~[N] | Always / Conditional |
| **Agent floor total** | | **~[N] (`agent_floor_est_tokens`)** | **Paid on every turn** |

> **Skill-filtered tools — token scoping (SK-6):** Tools in `agent tools:` that also appear in any skill's `allowed-tools` are filtered from the agent's base tool set by the platform (visible only when that skill is active). `extract_agent_info.py` automatically excludes these from `tool_list_est_tokens`, `tools_spec_est_tokens`, and `agent_floor_est_tokens`. The floor reflects only `active_resolved_tools`. Having tools filtered this way is the correct and expected pattern — it is not a reliability gap in itself. The reliability gaps are: **SK-6 Trigger 3** (agent instructions reference a skill-filtered tool — the tool is declared but unreachable at base level; see SK-6 Tool-shadowing analysis section above); **SK-6 Trigger 3a** (`active_resolved_tools` empty — no tools at all at base level). Neither is a token issue; both are execution reliability issues.

#### Level 2 — Skill context (added on top of Level 1 when a skill is loaded)

| Component | Chars | Est. Tokens | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Loaded skill body (avg) | [N] | ~[N] (`body_est_tokens` avg) | On every intent turn where a skill is loaded |
| Loaded skill body (max — [skill-name]) | [N] | ~[N] | On [intent type] turns |
| Skill allowed-tool list — names (avg) | [N] | ~[N] | Injected when skill loads — owned by the skill, not the agent |
| Skill allowed-tool specs — schemas (avg) | [N] | ~[N] (`allowed_tools_spec_est_tokens` avg) | Injected when skill loads — owned by the skill, not the agent |
| KB / retrieval tool output ([tool-name], [N] passages est.) | — | ~[N] | On [intent type] turns — see passage count note |
| **Typical skill-load cost (avg body + avg allowed-tools)** | | **~[N]** | Added to Level 1 floor |
| **Complex skill-load cost (max body + max allowed-tools + KB)** | | **~[N]** | Added to Level 1 floor |
| **Multi-step turn ([A] then [B] sequentially)** | | **~[N] per load** | On ~[N]% of turns — each load replaces the previous body |

#### Level 3 — Collaborator context (separate LLM call, own context window)

> Collaborator instructions, tools, and skills run in an entirely separate context window. These tokens are **not additive to Level 1 or Level 2** — they are a distinct per-call budget. Report collaborator token cost separately, not as part of the agent floor.

| Collaborator | Instructions | Tool list | Tool specs | Skill catalog | Per-call floor |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [collab-name] | ~[N] (`instructions_est_tokens`) | ~[N] | ~[N] | ~[N] | ~[N] |

---

> **Note — skill load model:** Only one skill body is active at a time. A turn that requires two sequential skill loads pays for each body (+ its allowed-tools) separately — the first is replaced when the second loads, not summed.
>
> **Note — allowed-tools scoping:** A skill's `allowed-tools` names and schemas are owned by the skill and injected only when that skill loads. They are **not** part of the agent's Level 1 floor. Do not include them in the agent floor total.
>
> **Note — collaborator scoping:** Collaborator internal costs (instructions, tools, skills) are in the collaborator's own context window. Only the collaborator's routing tokens (name + description) appear in the supervisor's Level 1 context.
>
> **KB / retrieval note:** Retrieved passages are injected into context at runtime and are **not visible to static analysis**. Use ≥500 tokens/passage as a conservative lower-bound estimate (typical chunks: 500–1,500 tokens). If no limit is stated, flag as High risk (unbounded). Always state as an approximation; exact values require runtime tracing.

## Optimization Opportunity Inventory

> Opportunities are grouped by surface. **Agent instruction optimizations first** — they have universal per-turn impact. Skill body optimizations follow.

### Agent Instruction Optimizations

#### OPT-1 — [Short title]

**Category:** Agent instructions
**Severity:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Current cost:** [N] lines / ~[N] tokens (paid on every turn)
**Removable:** ~[N] lines (~[X]% of current [total]-line agent instructions)

**Evidence:**
> [Direct quote or section reference from agent instructions]

**Root cause:** [missing tool schema / missing plugin hook / missing server-side state / copy-paste from prior version]

**Recommendation:** [Move to tool schema / move to plugin / move to server-side state / remove as redundant]
- **Target:** [What the agent instructions look like after: e.g., "reduce the tool-call contract section from 12 lines to a 2-line trigger + relay rule"]
- **Estimated saving:** ~[N] lines removed (~[X]% of current [total]-line agent instructions) → ~[Z] tokens saved on **every turn**

**Cross-report:** [PERF-N — also eliminates N inference hop / REL-N — also resolves Rule A/B/C/E/F signal / No cross-report overlap]

---

#### OPT-2 — [Short title]

[Same structure as OPT-1]

[Continue for all agent instruction opportunities]

---

### Skill Body Optimizations

#### OPT-[N] — Knowledge base / retrieval token risk

**Category:** KB / retrieval
**Severity:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Location:** [Agent instructions / Skill body — skill-name]
**Retrieval surface:** [tool-name] — identified as KB/retrieval tool by [name pattern / kind: knowledge_base / description keyword]
**Passage count:** [stated limit: N / no limit stated — unbounded]
**Call frequency:** [Always / On [intent type] turns / Conditional on [condition]]
**Estimated retrieval payload per call:** ~[N] passages × ≥500 tokens (lower bound) = ~[N] tokens
> ⚠ Passage token cost is a **runtime variable** — chunk size is set in the knowledge base configuration, not in the agent instructions, and cannot be verified from static analysis. The estimate above uses ≥500 tokens/passage as a conservative lower bound. Actual cost may be significantly higher (typically 500–1,500 tokens/passage). Verify with runtime tracing for an accurate figure.

**Evidence:**
> [Quote from instructions or tool definition showing KB reference; quote any passage count or limit; quote any condition or absence of condition]

**Risk assessment:**
- Passage count risk: [High — no limit / High — limit > 5 / Medium — limit 4–5 / Low — limit ≤ 3]
- Call frequency risk: [High — every turn / Medium — most turns / Low — conditional, infrequent]
- **Latency risk:** [High — unconstrained payload / Medium — bounded but large / Low — small bounded payload]
- Combined: [High / Medium / Low]

**Recommendation:** [Add or lower `top_k`/`max_results` to ≤ 3–5 / Condition the KB call on intent type / Restrict query scope / Merge with a prior tool call]
- **Target:** [e.g., "limit to top_k=3 on lookup intent turns; remove KB call entirely on simple-status turns"]
- **Estimated saving (token):** ~[N] lines removed (~[X]% of [component] current size) → ~[Z] tokens per [intent type] turn; ~[N]% of all turns affected
- **Estimated saving (latency):** [qualitative — "measurable latency reduction on [intent type] turns" — exact figures require runtime profiling]

**Cross-report:** PERF-N — this finding also applies to the performance optimization report (Rule P); cross-reference both. [REL-N — also resolves Rule X signal / No additional overlap]

---

#### OPT-[N] — [Short title]

**Category:** Skill body
**Severity:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Current cost:** [N] lines / ~[N] tokens in this skill body (paid when [intent type] is loaded)
**Removable:** ~[N] lines (~[X]% of current [total]-line skill body)

**Evidence:**
> [Direct quote or structural evidence from SKILL.md body]

**Root cause:** [copy-paste / coupling architecture / missing plugin / LLM-side classification / sequential-load pair]

**Recommendation:** [Consolidate skills / move to plugin / externalize to tool / remove repeated preamble]
- **Target:** [Target body size or structural outcome]
- **Estimated saving:** ~[N] lines removed (~[X]% of current [total]-line skill body) → ~[Z] tokens per [affected turn type]; ~[N]% of all turns affected

**Cross-report:** [PERF-N — also eliminates N inference hop / REL-N — also resolves Rule X signal / No cross-report overlap]

## Summary: Projected Savings

> Savings are estimated as a percentage of the current component size (no rewrite assumed). Formula: removable lines ÷ total current lines × 100% → translate to tokens via `removable chars ÷ 4`.

| Item | Category | Current size | Lines removable | % saving | Est. tokens saved/turn | Turns affected |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| OPT-1: [title] | Agent instructions | [N] lines | ~[N] | ~[X]% | ~[Z] — **every turn** | All turns |
| OPT-2: [title] | Agent instructions | [N] lines | ~[N] | ~[X]% | ~[Z] — **every turn** | All turns |
| OPT-[N]: [title] | Skill: [name] | [N] lines | ~[N] | ~[X]% | ~[Z] | [intent type] turns |
| [Continue] | | | | | | |
| **Total** | | | **~[N] lines** | | **~[Z] (peak), ~[Z] (avg)** | |

### Revised per-turn estimates (post-optimization)

| Turn type | Current estimate | Post-opt estimate | Saving |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Typical turn (agent + catalog + avg skill) | ~[N] tokens | ~[N] tokens | ~[N]% |
| Complex turn (agent + catalog + max skill) | ~[N] tokens | ~[N] tokens | ~[N]% |
| Multi-step turn (sequential [A] then [B]) | ~[N] tokens/load | ~[N] tokens/load | ~[N]% |
| [Other key turn types] | ~[N] tokens | ~[N] tokens | ~[N]% |

## Implementation Priority

| Priority | Item | Category | Effort | Impact | Cross-report |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | OPT-[N]: [title] | Agent instr. / Skill / KB | Low/Med/High | High — every turn / [N]% of turns | OPT-N / PERF-N / None |
| **P2** | OPT-[N]: [title] | Agent instr. / Skill / KB | Low/Med/High | Medium | OPT-N / PERF-N / None |
| [Continue] | | | | | |

> [1–2 sentences on suggested delivery sequence. Note that agent instruction optimizations (P1 candidates) should generally be delivered before skill body optimizations because their savings compound across all turns.]

## Token Footprint Reference

### Agent Instructions

| Section | Current lines | Est. tokens | After opt | Target lines | Primary opportunity |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---|
| [Section name, e.g. `# TOOL_CONTRACT`] | [N] | ~[N] | OPT-[N] | ~[N] | [short description] |
| [Continue per section] | | | | | |
| **Total agent instructions** | **[N]** | **~[N]** | | **~[N]** | **−[N]% agent token load** |

### Skill Bodies

| Skill | Current lines | Est. tokens | After opt | Target tokens | Primary opportunity |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---|
| [skill-name] | [N] | ~[N] | OPT-[N] | ~[N] | [short description] |
| [Continue for each skill] | | | | | |
| **Total skill set** | **[N]** | **~[N]** | | **~[N]** | **−[N]% total skill token load** |

> Note: Token estimates use **character count ÷ 4** (≈4 chars/token). `extract_agent_info.py` computes these automatically — use the reported `body_est_tokens` per skill and `instructions_est_tokens` per section directly. Actual values depend on the tokenizer and language model.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid in Future Iterations

[List the specific anti-patterns found in this evaluation. For each, state what it is, where it appeared (agent instructions or skill body), and what overhead it created. If no anti-patterns were found, write: "No anti-patterns identified — the current design avoids all known token inflation patterns."]

1. **[Anti-pattern name]** — [What it is, where it appeared, and what overhead it created]
2. [Continue for all found patterns]

---

*Side report — does not modify achievability scores in the main reports.*

*Issues found:* Implement the optimizations above and re-run the evaluation with the updated files. *No issues found:* No token optimization opportunities were identified by static analysis. Re-run this evaluation after any significant change to agent instructions, skill bodies, or tool schemas.
```

---

## Template 5: Performance Optimization Report

Use this structure for `performance_optimization_report.md`. This report is **always produced** as part of every evaluation — it does not re-score the five evaluation dimensions.

**Coverage:** This report covers **two performance surfaces**:
- **Tool execution architecture** — tool-call RTTs (round-trip times: the elapsed time between the agent issuing a tool call and receiving its response), `next_action` multi-hop chains, sequential chains that could be collapsed, unconditional routing calls
- **Orchestration depth** — skill/collaborator layer count, redundant routing hops, guidelines overhead

**Relationship to token optimization:** Token cost (Rule O) and execution call-graph depth (Rule P) are complementary. Where an optimization reduces both tokens *and* hops, note it in both reports and flag the dual benefit here.

**When no issues are found:** still produce the full report. Use "None found" for each checklist item, include the current call-graph baseline table, omit the PERF-N inventory section (or note "No opportunities identified"), and close with the standard baseline statement.

# Runtime Performance Optimization Report
## [Agent Name]

> See also: [token_optimization_report.md](token_optimization_report.md) · [reliability_optimization_report.md](reliability_optimization_report.md)
> Generated: [date]
> Scope: Execution architecture, tool call-graph depth, and orchestration overhead

---

## Purpose

[1–2 sentences. State the optimization goal in latency/throughput terms: what is the estimated per-turn call-graph depth today, and what is a realistic target? Note which turn types are worst-case.]

---

## Current State Baseline

### Execution Profile (per turn, estimated)

| Turn type | Inference hops | Tool-call RTTs | Skill loads | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Simple intent (no routing ambiguity) | [N] | [N] | [N] | [e.g. agent instr + 1 skill load + 1 tool call] |
| Complex intent (routing + multi-step) | [N] | [N] | [N] | [e.g. classify → skill load → domain tool → next_action → second tool] |
| Multi-step turn (sequential skill loads) | [N] | [N] | [N] | [e.g. load skill A → replace with skill B — each load is a separate inference pass] |
| Multi-step completion turn | [N] | [N] | [N] | [e.g. domain tool + state tool + close tool] |
| Special first-turn handling | [N] | [N] | [N] | [if applicable] |

> Latency model: inference hop ≈ 500ms–2s; tool-call RTT ≈ 50ms–500ms; skill load ≈ 1 inference hop + token overhead. All estimates are approximations — production profiling required for exact values.

---

## Optimization Opportunity Inventory

> Opportunities are grouped by category. Tool execution opportunities first — they have the most direct latency impact.

### Tool Execution Architecture

#### PERF-1 — [Short title]

**Category:** Tool execution
**Severity:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Current cost:** [N] tool-call RTTs + [N] inference hops on [turn type] turns
**Frequency:** ~[N]% of all turns / every turn / [specific trigger condition]

**Evidence:**
> [Direct quote from agent instructions, skill body, or tool call sequence description]

**Root cause:** [Missing tool composition / missing agentic workflow / missing pre-invoke plugin / `next_action` dispatch chain not encapsulated]

**Recommendation:** [Python tool chain / agentic workflow wrap / pre-invoke plugin migration / tool composition]

**Mechanism:** [How this reduces latency — e.g. "eliminates 1 tool-call RTT on every turn by absorbing the classification tool's output into the prior tool response"; "wraps 3-step `next_action` chain into a single agentic workflow call, reducing 3 RTTs to 1"]

**Estimated impact:** [RTTs eliminated per turn type]; [inference hops eliminated]; ~[N]% of all turns affected

**Cross-report:** [OPT-N — also reduces ~N tokens per turn / REL-N — also resolves reliability signal / No cross-report overlap]

---

#### PERF-2 — [Short title]

[Same structure as PERF-1]

[Continue for all tool execution opportunities]

---

### Orchestration Depth

#### PERF-[N] — [Short title]

**Category:** Orchestration depth — [skill routing / collaborator stack / in-skill re-routing]
**Severity:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Current cost:** [N] extra inference hops per turn from [routing pattern]
**Frequency:** ~[N]% of turns / every intent turn

**Evidence:**
> [Quote or structural observation from agent YAML, skill body, or collaborators list]

**Root cause:** [Skill load required for every intent / over-decomposed collaborators / redundant in-skill re-route]

**Recommendation:** [Collapse into agent instructions / consolidate collaborators / replace re-route with inline rule]

**Mechanism:** [e.g. "collapsing high-frequency skill body into agent instructions eliminates 1 `load_skill` inference hop for those intents"; "merging 3 narrow collaborators into 1 broader collaborator with shared tool access eliminates 2 delegation hops"]

**Estimated impact:** [hops eliminated]; [turn types affected]; [% of total volume]

**Cross-report:** [OPT-N — also saves ~N tokens by eliminating redundant preamble / REL-N — also resolves reliability signal / No cross-report overlap]

---

[Continue for all orchestration depth opportunities]

---

### Guidelines Overhead

#### PERF-[N] — [Short title]

**Category:** Guidelines overhead
**Severity:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Current cost:** [N] guidelines × 1 constraint-check pass overhead per turn = [N] extra constraint evaluations on every turn
**Frequency:** Every turn

**Evidence:**
> [List guidelines that fall into the identified patterns — restating instructions, expressing tool-call logic, complex conditions]

**Root cause:** [Guidelines used for execution logic rather than behavioral guardrails / guidelines duplicate instruction rules / guidelines have complex multi-clause conditions]

**Recommendation:** [Move to instructions / move to tool schema / remove as duplicate / decompose into instruction rule]

**Mechanism:** [e.g. "removing 3 guidelines that duplicate instruction rules reduces per-turn constraint evaluation surface; the remaining 2 behavioral guardrails are appropriate guideline use"]

**Estimated impact:** [N] guidelines removed; constraint evaluation surface reduced from [N] to [N] per turn

**Cross-report:** [OPT-N — also saves ~N tokens / REL-N — also resolves Rule F signal / No cross-report overlap]

---

[Continue for all guidelines opportunities]

> [1–2 sentences on delivery sequence. Note dependencies: tool composition changes (P1) typically need to be deployed before orchestration changes that depend on the composed tool's new return schema.]

---

## Tool Composition Candidates

List every tool chain that could be collapsed into a deterministic server-side pipeline. For each, name the component tools, the sequence, and the recommended composition pattern.

**Mechanism selection guide:**
- **`nextTool` chaining** (`_meta.nextTool`) — Each tool returns `_meta: { nextTool: { tool, parameters } }` to trigger the next step directly without an LLM pass. Branching is supported (a tool can conditionally emit different `nextTool` values) but branch logic is hardcoded inside the tool — changes require modifying and redeploying the tool. User interaction is supported for simple single Q&A only. Choose when: ≤5 steps; all steps within a single Python MCP server; branching logic (if any) is stable and acceptable to hardcode; user interaction (if any) is simple Q&A; no transaction audit/observability record required per execution.
- **Agentic Workflow** (`@flow` / WxO Agentic Workflow JSON) — branching is expressed as explicit edges in the flow graph (business logic changes without touching tool code); user-interaction nodes support full multi-step confirmations; built-in per-node observability events are emitted automatically (no extra instrumentation for execution tracing or compliance logging). Choose when any of: branch logic is likely to evolve; multi-step user confirmation required mid-sequence; cross-server tool calls; >5 steps; transaction logic that needs an audit or observability record (payment, booking, cancellation, account change); anticipated future editability of the sequence.
- **Pre-invoke plugin** — for mandatory context hydration calls that must fire before every turn; removes the call from the LLM instruction path entirely.

| Chain | Component tools | Sequence type | Steps | Branches? | Single server? | Recommended mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [chain name] | [tool-A → tool-B → tool-C] | [Sequential / conditional] | [N] | [Yes / No] | [Yes / No] | `nextTool` chaining / Agentic Workflow / Pre-invoke plugin |
| [Continue for each candidate] | | | | | | |

## Template 6: Reliability Optimization Report

Use this structure for `reliability_optimization_report.md`. This report is **always produced** as part of every evaluation — it does not re-score the five evaluation dimensions.

**This is a synthesis report:** every REL-N item must trace back to evidence already present in the main agent report or skill reports. It does not introduce new findings; it reorganises existing findings into a prioritised, implementation-ready rewrite plan grouped by failure class.

**Relationship to other side reports:** When a REL-N fix also reduces token cost, cross-reference the corresponding `OPT-N` item from the token optimization report. When a fix also reduces hops, cross-reference `PERF-N` from the performance optimization report. Do not re-explain the full recommendation — a one-line cross-reference is sufficient.

**When no issues are found:** still produce the full report. Run the full Rule Q checklist, record "None found" for each pattern, and close with the standard baseline statement.

### Harness notes
- Preserve deterministic signal counts exactly as summarized from accepted incidents
- Use deterministic signals to **bound** judgment, not replace it
- Do not fabricate counts
- If a signal cannot be determined confidently, mark it as `unknown` and explain why
- The running LLM should extract **evidence-backed incidents**
- The simple tool should count, deduplicate, cluster, validate, or render those incidents
- Do not require the simple tool to call another LLM
```

## Section Guidelines

### Report set discipline
- Save each report to disk immediately after it is fully written. Do not hold all reports in memory and write them together.
- The agent report must be written before skill reports, because it establishes cross-skill context (SK-2, SK-6, SK-7). Skill reports are independent of each other and may be written in any order.
- The index is written last, after all individual reports are complete, because it references their verdicts and scores.
- If saving to disk is not possible in the current environment, output each report as a labelled block in chat (agent report first, then each skill report, then the index), making clear that each block is a separate file.

### Artifact Summary
Keep this concise. The overall verdict should be 1-2 sentences maximum. For skill reports, include the skill name and its parent agent in the summary.

### Extraction and Tool Summary
Be honest about the analysis mode. If no tool was used, say so clearly and explain the confidence impact. For skill reports, list the `allowed-tools`, `scripts/`, and `references/` counts explicitly — these are the tool grounding surface for the skill.

### Dimension Scorecard
This is a quick-reference table. Keep entries brief. Full details go in Dimension Analysis section. Scores in skill reports are scoped to the skill body only — do not blend agent-level context.

### Deterministic Signal Summary
Provide actual counts, not ranges. If you cannot count confidently, say "unknown" and explain why. For skill reports, count signals in the SKILL.md body exclusively (do not include agent instructions counts).

### Overall Interpretation
Use qualitative interpretation bands:
- Very high-risk / Not achievable as written (any dimension 0-1)
- High-risk (two or more dimensions ≤2)
- Moderate-risk (mixed scores, some fragility)
- Low-risk (most dimensions 3-4, targeted improvements needed)
- Strong (all dimensions 4-5)

### Dimension Analysis
Provide full reasoning for each score. Quote evidence. Explain why the score is what it is, not just what the score means.

**Special note for Execution & Tool Grounding:** If tools are referenced in the prompt but their formal definitions (schemas, APIs, specifications) were not included in the evaluation input, explicitly note this limitation in the dimension analysis. State that the score reflects only what could be assessed from the prompt text, and recommend that the user include tool definitions and re-run the evaluation for a complete assessment. Example language: "Note: This evaluation is based solely on tool references in the prompt. Tool definitions (schemas, APIs, specifications) were not provided. For a complete assessment of tool grounding, include formal tool definitions and re-run this evaluation."

**For skill reports:** Also check whether all tools referenced in the SKILL.md body are present in the skill's `allowed-tools`. A tool mentioned in the body but absent from `allowed-tools` is an execution gap — call this out explicitly in Dimension 3.

### Findings
Each finding must have all five elements: Evidence, Why it matters, Deterministic or judgment-based, Score impact, Recommended change. In skill reports, findings should reference the specific SKILL.md body line or section where the issue appears. Do not repeat agent-level findings in skill reports — the skill report covers only the skill body.

**Translation requirement (mandatory):** Every non-English quote in an Evidence block must be followed immediately by a `[Translation]: ...` line containing the English rendering. Do not skip this even for short phrases or when the meaning seems obvious. The reviewer may not read the source language.

### Key Risks
Focus on production failure modes, not theoretical concerns.

### High-Impact Changes
Prioritize by leverage: changes that improve multiple dimensions or address critical blockers.

### Rewrite Targets
Point to specific sections, line numbers, or rule bundles that contain the highest concentration of issues. For each target, describe what problems exist and suggest a rewrite strategy (approach/direction) without prescribing exact outcomes or specific line counts.

### Skill Reports (agent report section)
List every resolved skill with a relative Markdown link. List unresolved skills by name with a note explaining why they could not be resolved. This section makes the agent report the navigation entry point for the full report set.

### Runtime Performance Risk — Skill sections (agent report only)
The skill architecture performance surface table must be filled in whenever `skills:` are present, even if all components rate Low. Omit only when the agent has no `skills:` list at all. The correlated pairs table should only appear when at least one pair meets a Rule M trigger.

For skill reports, the Runtime Performance Risk section covers only the cost of loading and reasoning over this skill body — not the full agent architecture overhead. Do not include the skill architecture performance surface table in skill reports.

### Skill Health — This Skill (skill reports only)
SK-2, SK-6, and SK-7 are cross-skill checks and belong in the agent report only. Skill reports contain SK-1, SK-3, SK-4, and SK-5 for the skill in question. Do not attempt to assess SK-2/SK-6/SK-7 in isolation inside a skill report — they require the full skill set to be meaningful.

### Skill Health Summary (agent report only)
Place this section immediately after Dimension Analysis and before Findings in the agent report. The summary table uses P/W/F/N codes — full analysis is in per-skill reports. Agent dimension adjustments apply only for SK-2 Exact/High overlap, SK-3 hard-limit failures, and SK-6 Trigger 3 (agent instruction references a skill-filtered tool). SK-6 Trigger 3a (zero `active_resolved_tools`) produces an intentionality note only — no dimension adjustment. Consolidation recommendations must include a concrete merge strategy: which `allowed-tools` to carry forward, how to combine the body sections, what to do with the `description` frontmatter.

### Token Optimization Report
This report is always produced — it synthesizes evidence gathered across the agent report and all skill reports. Produce it after all individual reports are written. Run the full Rule O checklist and record a severity (High / Medium / Low / None found) for each pattern. When no issues are found, record the current token budget as a verified baseline and close with the standard baseline statement; do not produce an empty file. Follow Template 4.

### Performance Optimization Report
This report is always produced — focused on execution call-graph depth, tool composition, orchestration layers, and guidelines overhead. Produce it after the token optimization report so it can cross-reference Rule O items for dual-benefit opportunities. Run the full Rule P checklist and record a severity for each pattern. When no issues are found, record the current call-graph baseline and close with the standard baseline statement; do not produce an empty file. Follow Template 5.

### Reliability Optimization Report
This report is always produced — a synthesis of findings from the main evaluation reports reorganised into a prioritised, implementation-ready rewrite plan grouped by failure class. Produce it last among the three side reports (after token and performance) so it can cross-reference both OPT-N and PERF-N items. Every REL-N item must trace back to evidence in the main reports — do not introduce new findings. Run the full Rule Q checklist and record a severity for each pattern. When no issues are found, record a stability baseline and close with the standard statement; do not produce an empty file. Follow Template 6. The three side reports are siblings — flag cross-report overlaps with one-line cross-references but do not merge the reports.

### Index
The index is a navigation and summary document, not an analysis document. Keep it brief. Every report file in the eval/ directory must appear in the Report Set table. The Skill Health Summary table uses single-letter codes (P/W/F) for space; the full ratings are in the individual reports. The `rules-summary.md`, `token_optimization_report.md`, `performance_optimization_report.md`, and `reliability_optimization_report.md` files must always be present in the eval/ directory and linked from the index's Reference Documents section. For the three side reports, the one-line description should indicate whether issues were found (summarise the top result) or none were found (state "baseline recorded").

### Evaluation Harness Handoff
Both agent and skill JSON files must include `"report_type": "agent"` or `"report_type": "skill"` as the first key to make them machine-distinguishable. The agent JSON must include `skill_health` whenever skills are evaluated. The skill JSON must include `skill_health_this_skill` with only SK-1/SK-3/SK-4/SK-5. Omit the `skill_health` key from skill reports entirely.
